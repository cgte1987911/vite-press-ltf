#### 1. The dead return

A Festival for the Dead is held once a year in Japan. This festival is a cheerful occasion, for on this day, the dead are said to return to their homes and they are welcomed by the living. As they are expected to be hungry after their long journey, food is laid out for them. Specially-made lanterns are hung outside each house to help the dead to find their way. All night long, people dance and sing. In the early morning, the food that had been laid out for the dead is thrown into a river or into the sea as it is considered unlucky for anyone living to eat it. In towns that are near the sea, the tiny lanterns which had been hung in the streets the night before, are placed into the water when the festival is over. Thousands of lanterns slowly drift out to sea guiding the dead on their return journey to the other world. This is a moving spectacle, for crowds of people stand on the shore watching the lanterns drifting away until they can be seen no more.



#### 2. A Puma at large

Pumas are large, cat-like animals which are found in America. When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London, they were not taken seriously. However, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.

The hunt for the puma began in a small village where a woman picking blackberries saw 'a large cat' only five yards away from her. It immediately ran away when she saw it, and experts confirmed that a puma will not attack a human being unless it is cornered. The search proved difficult, for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place twenty miles away in the evening. Wherever it went, it left behind it a trail of dead deer and small animals like rabbits. Paw prints were seen in a number of places and puma fur was found clinging to bushes. Several people complained of "cat-like noises' at night and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree. The experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from? As no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country, this one must have been in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escape. The hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was not caught. It is disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside.



#### 3. Beauty

A young man sees a sunset and, unable to understand or to express the emotion that it rouses in him, concludes that it must be the gateway to a world that lies beyond. It is difficult for any of us in moments of intense aesthetic experience to resist the suggestion that we are catching a glimpse of a light that shines down to us from a different realm of existence, different and, because the experience is intensely moving, in some way higher. And, though the gleams blind and dazzle, yet do they convey a hint of beauty and serenity greater than we have known or imagined. Greater too than we can describe, for language, which was invented to convey the meanings of this world, cannot readily be fitted to the uses of another.

That all great art has this power of suggesting a world beyond is undeniable. In some moods Nature shares it. There is no sky in June so blue that it does not point forward to a bluer, no sunset so beautiful that it does not waken the vision of a greater beauty, a vision which passes before it is fully glimpsed, and in passing leaves an indefinable longing and regret. But, if this world is not merely a bad joke, life a vulgar flare amid the cool radiance of the stars, and existence an empty laugh braying across the mysteries; if these intimations of a something behind and beyond are not evil humour born of indigestion, or whimsies sent by the devil to mock and madden us, if, in a word, beauty means something, yet we must not seek to interpret the meaning. If we glimpse the unutterable, it is unwise to try to utter it, nor should we seek to invest with significance that which we cannot grasp. Beauty in terms of our human meanings is meaningless.

Not all of the potential solutions to climate change are futuristic, expensive or exotic. In fact, most Americans can find one of the most significant carbon-reducing innovations of the last 30 years standing in their kitchens, keeping the butter hard.

​    Refrigerators sold in the United States have grown 5% more energy efficient every year since 1975. Today they save 200 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity a year compared to what they’d use if they were still built to 30-year-old standards, or about a third of the annual output of all the nation’s nuclear plants. Upgraded fridges have lowered electricity bills for consumers and avoided millions of tons of carbon that would otherwise have been emitted by power plants. Heating and air-conditioning systems also have grown more efficient, and fluorescent light bulbs are a big step ahead of power-hungry incandescents.

​    Critics of government efforts to fend off global warming often complain that the economic costs aren’t worth the gains - better to adapt later to a warmer planet than suffer now by turning down the thermostat. This argument relies on a lot of dubious assumptions, starting with the notion that quality of life won’t be significantly reduced in a world plagued by drought, wildfires, increased disease and famine, more powerful storms, mass species extinction and higher sea levels. It also assumes that the cost of cleaning up after all that will be less than the cost of preventing it from happening.

​    Nicholas Stern, former chief economist with the World Bank, estimates that failing to invest in cutting carbon would eventually cost up to 20% in lost income worldwide. The final report from the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change pointed out adapting to global warming is a necessity because it’s too late to stop the process, but that doesn’t reduce the need to head off the worst effects.

​    Global-warming deniers are right about one thing: Phasing out fossil fuels will be expensive. But the most effective way of doing so not only doesn’t add costs, it saves money and boosts economies. Energy efficiency is the fastest, safest and cheapest method currently available for cutting carbon emission. It’s also one of the least understood, because it involves a lot more than adding insulation to buildings or installing power-sipping air conditioners. To make really hefty efficiency gains, the U.S. must follow California’s lead in restructuring incentives of utilities, and regulatory agencies should do much more to encourage important innovations such as cogeneration plants.



#### 5. Thirteen equals one
Our vicar is always raising money for one cause or another, but he has never managed to get enough money to have the church clock repaired. The big clock which used to strike the hours day and night was damaged many years ago and has been silent ever since.

　　One night, however, our vicar woke up with a start: the clock was striking the hours! Looking at his watch, he saw that it was one o'clock, but the bell struck thirteen times before it stopped. Armed with a torch, the vicar went up into the clock tower to see what was going on. In the torchlight, he caught sight of a figure whom he immediately recognized as Bill Wilkins, our local grocer.

　　'Whatever are you doing up here Bill?' asked the vicar in surprise.

　　'I'm trying to repair the bell,' answered Bill. 'I've been coming up here night after night for weeks now. You see, I was hoping to give you a surprise.'

　　'You certainly did give me a surprise!' said the vicar. 'You've probably woken up everyone in the village as well. Still, I'm glad the bell is working again.'

　　That's the trouble, vicar,' answered Bill. 'It's working all right, but I'm afraid that at one o'clock it will strike thirteen times and there's nothing I can do about it."

　　We'll get used to that, Bill,' said the vicar. "Thirteen is not as good as one, but it's better than nothing. Now let's go downstairs and have a cup of tea."



#### 6. An unknow goddess

Some time ago, an interesting discovery was made by archaeologists on the Aegean island of Kea. An American team explored a temple which stands in an ancient city on the promontory of Ayia Irini. The city at one time must have been prosperous, for it enjoyed a high level of civilization. Houses -- often three storeys high -- were built of stone. They had large rooms with beautifully decorated walls. The city was even equipped with a drainage system, for a great many clay pipes were found beneath the narrow streets.

　　The temple which the archaeologists explored was used as a place of worship from the fifteenth century B.C. until Roman times. In the most sacred room of the temple, clay fragments of fifteen statues were found. Each of these represented a goddess and had, at one time, been painted. The body of one statue was found among remains dating from the fifteenth century B.C. Its missing head happened to be among remains of the fifth century B.C. This head must have been found in Classical times and carefully preserved. It was very old and precious even then. When the archaeologists reconstructed the fragments, they were amazed to find that the goddess turned out to be a very modern-looking woman. She stood three feet high and her hands rested on her hips. She was wearing a full-length skirt which swept the ground. Despite her great age, she was very graceful indeed, but, so far, the archaeologists have been unable to discover her identity.



#### 7. The double life of Alfred Bloggs

These days, people who do manual work often receive far more money than people who work in offices. People who work in offices are frequently referred to as 'white-collar workers' for the simple reason that they usually wear a collar and tie to go to work. Such is human nature, that a great many people are often willing to sacrifice higher pay for the privilege of becoming white-collar workers. This can give rise to curious situations, as it did in the case of Alfred Bloggs who worked as a dustman for the Ellesmere Corporation.
When he got married, Alf was too embarrassed to say anything to his wife about his job. He simply told her that he worked for the Corporation. Every morning, he left home dressed in a smart black suit. He then changed into overalls and spent the next eight hours as a dustman. Before returning home at night, he took a shower and changed back into his suit.  Alf did this for over two years and his fellow dustmen kept his secret. Alf's wife has never discovered that she married a dustman and she never will, for Alf has just found another job. He will soon be working in an office . He will be earning only half as much as he used to, but he feels that his rise in status is well worth the loss of money. From now on, he will wear a suit all day and others will call him 'Mr. Bloggs', not 'Alf'.



 #### 8. The facts

 Editors of newspapers and magazines often go to extremes to provide their readers with unimportant facts and statistics. Last year a journalist had been instructed by a well-known magazine to write an article on the president's palace in a new African republic. When the article arrived, the editor read the first sentence and then refused to publish it. The article began: 'Hundreds of steps lead to the high wall which surrounds the president's palace.' The editor at once sent the journalist a fax instructing him to find out the exact number of steps and the height of the wall.  

 The journalist immediately set out to obtain these important facts, but he took a long time to send them. Meanwhile, the editor was getting impatient, for the magazine would soon go to press. He sent the journalist two more faxes, but received no reply. He sent yet another fax informing the journalist that if he did not reply soon he would be fired. When the journalist again failed to reply, the editor reluctantly published the article as it had originally been written. A week later, the editor at last received a fax from the journalist. Not only had the poor man been arrested, but he had been sent to prison as well. However, he had at last been allowed to send a fax in which he informed the editor that he had been arrested while counting the 1,084 steps leading to the fifteen-foot wall which surrounded the president's palace.



 #### 9. Youth

People are always talking about “the problem of youth". If there is one -- which I take leave to doubt -- then it is older people who create it, not the young themselves. Let us get down to fundamentals and agree that the young are after all human beings -- people just like their elders. There is only one difference between an old man and a young one: the young man has a glorious future before him and the old one has a splendid future behind him: and maybe that is where the rub is.

When I was a teenager, I felt that I was just young and uncertain -- that I was a new boy in a huge school, and I would have been very pleased to be regarded as something so interesting as a problem. For one thing, being a problem gives you a certain identity, and that is one of the things the young are busily engaged in seeking.

I find young people exciting. They have an air of freedom, and they have not a dreary commitment to mean ambitions or love of comfort. They are not anxious social climbers, and they have no devotion to material things. All this seems to me to link them with life, and the origins of things. It's as if they were, in some sense, cosmic beings in violent and lovely contrast with us suburban creatures. All that is in my mind when I meet a young person. He may be conceited, ill-mannered, presumptuous or fatuous, but I do not turn for protection to dreary cliches about respect of elders -- as if mere age were a reason for respect. I accept that we are equals, and I will argue with him, as an equal, if I think he is wrong.



#### 10. Hobbies

A gifted American psychologist has said, 'Worry is a spasm of the emotion; the mind catches hold of something and will not let it go.' It is useless to argue with the mind in this condition. The stronger the will, the more futile the task. One can only gently insinuate something else into its convulsive grasp. And if this something else is rightly chosen, if it is really attended by the illumination of another field of interest, gradually, and often quite swiftly, the old undue grip relaxes and the process of recuperation and repair begins.

The cultivation of a hobby and new forms of interest is therefore a policy of the first importance to a public man. But this is not a business that can be undertaken in a day or swiftly improvised by a mere command of the will. The growth of alternative mental interests is a long process. The seeds must be carefully chosen; they must fall on good ground; they must be sedulously tended, if the vivifying fruits are to be at hand when needed.

To be really happy and really safe, one ought to have at least two or three hobbies, and they must all be real. It is no use starting late in life to say: 'I will take an interest in this or that.' Such an attempt only aggravates the strain of mental effort. A man may acquire great knowledge of topics unconnected with his daily work, and yet get hardly any benefit or relief. It is no use doing what you like; you have got to like what you do. Broadly speaking, human beings may be divided into three classes: those who are toiled to death, those who are worried to death, and those who are bored to death. It is no use offering the manual labourer, tired out with a hard week's sweat and effort, the chance of playing a game of football or baseball on Saturday afternoon. It is no use inviting the politician or the professional or business man, who has been working or worrying about serious things for six days, to work or worry about trifling things at the weekend.

As for the unfortunate people who can command everything they want, who can gratify every caprice and lay their hands on almost every object of desire--for them a new pleasure, a new excitement is only an additional satiation.In vain they rush frantically round from place to place, trying to escape from avenging boredom by mere clatter and motion. For them discipline in one form or another is the most hopeful path.

It may also be said that rational, industrious, useful human beings are divided into two classes: first, those whose work is work and whose pleasure is pleasure; and secondly, those whose work and pleasure are one. Of these the former are the majority. They have their compensations. The long hours in the office or the factory bring with them as their reward, not only the means of sustenance, but a keen appetite for pleasure even in its simplest and most modest forms. But Fortune's favoured children belong to the second class. Their life is a natural harmony. For them the working hours are never long enough. Each day is a holiday, and ordinary holidays, when they come, are grudged as enforced interruptions in an absorbing vocation. Yet to both classes, the need of an alternative outlook, of a change of atmosphere, of a diversion of effort, is essential. Indeed, it may well be that those whose work is their pleasure are those who most need the means of banishing it at intervals from their minds.

Our understanding of the Emotional System today is still in the Dark Ages. This has its analogy to the time when people’s understanding of our Solar System was based upon the belief that the Sun revolved around the Earth, as it certainly appeared that way----however, just the reverse was true. The problem was, as long as we believed the Sun went around the Earth, we were limited as to how far we could go in the Solar System.

​    We find the same condition existing today in regard to the Emotional System. Society believes that our emotional feelings are a result of our experiences in our environment. In essence: something happened and it made me feel the way I do. This belief, though it is certainly the way it appears, is just the reverse of it really works.

​    What happens to us as we embrace an emotional feeling is that it is first received by our brain, which converts it into electrical energy that flows through our body by means of the central nervous system. We can often “feel the charge” in our body associated with the experience of emotions. When this occurs an electromagnetic field is generated around our body which attracts to us another person who has an identical electromagnetic field around their body and the same emotional feeling in their heart.

​    We have not been able to make much progress in the emotional area. Let’s face it, although this age reflects great advancements in technology, the feelings in the hearts of men and women are still plagued by darkness.

​    Believing that something or someone made us feel the way we do gives rise to the concept of victimization. To see self as a victim places the responsibility for our feelings on someone or something other than self. The real problem with this view is that if we are not responsible for having created our feelings, we are also unable to change those feelings and create new and different ones.

​    This dilemma we face creates quite a struggle in life. Although we may externally struggle with different circumstances and situations, the emotional feelings associated with them are always the same-frustration, resentment, anger, etc. It is as if we have fallen into quicksand, gotten stuck, and the only way we know to extricate ourselves is to struggle. What we find is that the more we struggle to get out, the deeper in we sink.

​    To state a simple rule: there is an inverse relationship between struggling with a problem and understanding the problem. Understanding how the emotional system really works allows the resolution of problems without struggle. This understanding is the key to unlocking the emotional doorway to enter into the Kingdom of Heavenly Feelings within us.

Two years ago, a Danish environmentalist called Bjorn Lomborg had an idea. We all want to make the world a better place but, given finite resources, we should look for the most cost-effective ways of doing so. He persuaded a bunch of economists, including three Nobel laureates, to draw up a list of priorities. They found that efforts to fight malnutrition and disease would save many lives at modest expense, whereas fighting global warming would cost a colossal amount and yield distant and uncertain rewards.

​    That conclusion upset a lot of environmentalists. This week, another man who upsets a lot of people embraced it. John Bolton, America’s ambassador to the United Nations, said that Mr. Lomborg’s “Copenhagen consensus” provided a useful way for the world body to get its priorities straight. Too often at the UN, said Mr. Bolton, “everything is a priority.” The secretary-general is charged with carrying out 9,000 mandates, he said, and when you have 9,000 priorities you have none.

​    So, over the weekend, Mr. Bolton sat down with UN diplomats from seven other countries to rank 40 ways of tackling ten global crises. The problems addressed were climate change, communicable diseases, war, education, financial instability, governance, malnutrition, migration, clean water and trade barriers.

​    Given a notional $50 billion, how would the ambassadors spend it to make the world a better place? Their conclusions were strikingly similar to the Copenhagen Consensus. After hearing presentations from experts on each problem, they drew up a list of priorities. The top four were basic health care, better water and sanitation, more schools and better nutrition for children. Averting climate change came last.

​    The ambassadors thought it wiser to spend money on things they knew would work. Promoting breast-feeding, for example, costs very little and is proven to save lives. It also helps infants grow up stronger and more intelligent, which means they will earn more as adults. Vitamin A supplements cost as little as $1, save lives and stop people from going blind. And so on.

​    For climate change, the trouble is that though few dispute that it is occurring, no one knows how severe it will be or what damage it will cause. And the proposed solutions are staggeringly expensive. Mr. Lomborg reckons that the benefits of implementing the Kyoto protocol would probably outweigh the costs, but not until 2100. This calculation will not please Al Gore. Nipped at the post by George Bush is the most urgent moral challenge facing mankind.

The task of the global strategist of a business is to build a platform of capabilities derived from the resources, experiences and innovations of units operating in multiple locations, to transplant those capabilities wherever appropriate, and then to systematically upgrade and renew them — ahead of the competition. 

Apple is an outstanding case of a company whose unique capabilities give it a worldwide competitive advantage, particularly with respect to its ability to build platforms from a product base that integrates functional and aesthetic design. 

Apple has been able to leverage and exploit its California-based design and marketing advantages successfully throughout the world. 

IKEA is another such case. 

The do-it-yourself furniture and houseware company first developed a compelling set of capabilities to design, manufacture and ship furniture at low cost and sell it in a novel way in Sweden. 

Later, IKEA successfully reproduced this formula in many other countries. 

By contrast, Telefonica, a Spanish telecommunications company that is now the world's fifth largest telecom by revenues, first developed its special advantage abroad. 

In 1989 and 1990, Telefonica had the opportunity to enter Chile and Argentina, countries that shared many institutional and cultural characteristics with its home country but that were undergoing more rapid market reform. 

Throughout the 1990s, Telefonica took what it learned in Chile and Argentina about reconstructing former state-owned telecoms to other Latin American countries that were privatizing their state telecoms and deregulating their telecom markets. 

These examples might lead the reader to believe that creating a global advantage is an easy task. 

But many other instances of expensive failed experiments suggest that creating a lasting global advantage actually requires a great deal of strategic and operational finesse. 

Our research suggests that global winners typically create and sustain their international presence through a systematic process of exploiting, renewing and enhancing their core capabilities.

Could you get by without using the internet for four and a half years?

That's exactly what singer and actress Selena Gomez has done in a bid to improve her mental health.

She has spoken extensively about the relationship between her social media usage and her mental well-being, recalling feeling like "an addict" when she became Instagram's most followed user in 2016.

"Taking a break from social media was the best decision that I've ever made for my mental health", says she. "The unnecessary hate and comparisons went away once I put my phone down."

Ditching the web at large, however, is a far more subtle and complicated prospect.

The increasing digitisation of our society means that everything from paying a gas bill to plotting a route to a friend's house and even making a phone call is at the mercy of your internet connection.

Actively opting out of using the internet becomes a matter of privilege.

Ms Gomez's multi-millionaire status has allowed her to take the "social" out of social media, so she can continue to leverage her enormous fame while keeping the trolls at bay.

The fact that she's still the second most-followed woman on Instagram suggests it's entirely possible to maintain a significant web profile to promote various projects — by way of a dedicated team — without being exposed to the cruel comments, hate mail and rape or death threats.

It goes without saying that this is fundamentally different from how the rest of us without beauty deals and films to publicise use the likes of Instagram, TikTok and Twitter, but even the concept of a digital detox requires having a device and connectivity to choose to disconnect from.

The UK's digital divide has worsened over the past two years, leaving poorer families without broadband connections in their homes.

Digital exclusion is a major threat to wider societal equality in the UK, so witnessing companies like Facebook championing the metaverse as the next great frontier when school children are struggling to complete their homework feels particularly irritating.

Consequently, it's worth bearing in mind that while deleting all social media accounts will undoubtedly make some feel infinitely better, many other people benefit from the strong sense of community that sharing platforms can breed.

Internet access will continue to grow in importance as we edge further towards web 3.0, and greater resources and initiatives are needed to provide the underprivileged with the connectivity they desperately need to learn, work and live.

It's crucial that people who feel that social media is having a detrimental effect on their mental health are allowed to switch off and for those living in digital exclusion to be able to switch on in the first place.



#### 15. Nowadays many people use social media every day to keep in touch with others and news events. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages? Write an essay with no less than 250 words.
In today's era, social media has become an integral part of our lives. It's a platform where people share their experiences, ideas, emotions, and communicate with others. At the same time, it's also a medium for staying updated about current events and news. While social media undoubtedly has advantages, there are some disadvantages as well. In this essay, I will discuss whether the benefits of social media outweigh the drawbacks.

Social media has several advantages. Firstly, it provides an opportunity for people to connect with each other quickly and easily regardless of the distance between them. It enables people to communicate and share their thoughts and experiences with others. Moreover, it allows people to stay updated about current news events and various other happenings around the world. Social media also provides an excellent platform for businesses to promote their products and reach a wider audience.

Despite the benefits, social media also has some drawbacks. A significant disadvantage of social media is the negative impact it can have on mental health. Constantly seeing the success of others and getting affected by their opinions can lead to stress and anxiety. Furthermore, it can also be a source of addiction, leading to reduced productivity and other adverse effects. Moreover, the spread of misinformation is also a huge problem with social media, and it can lead to various issues.

In conclusion, while social media has its advantages and disadvantages, I believe that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. We can't imagine a world without social media today, and it has significantly improved communication and connectivity among people worldwide. However, it's necessary to use social media in moderation and be aware of the negative effects it might have on mental health. By doing so, we can continue enjoying the many benefits it offers.



#### 16. Running for Governor 

A few months ago I was nominated for Governor of the great state of New York, to run against Mr. John T. Smith and Mr. Blank J. Blank on an independent ticket. I somehow felt that I had one prominent advantage over these gentlemen, and that was--good character. It was easy to see by the newspapers that if ever they had known what it was to bear a good name, that time had gone by. It was plain that in these latter years they had become familiar with all manner of shameful crimes. But at the very moment that I was exalting my advantage and joying in it in secret, there was a muddy undercurrent of discomfort "riling" the deeps of my happiness, and that was--the having to hear my name bandied about in familiar connection with those of such people. I grew more and more disturbed. Finally I wrote my grandmother about it. Her answer came quick and sharp. She said: 

You have never done one single thing in all your life to be ashamed of--not one. Look at the newspapers--look at them and comprehend what sort of characters Messrs. Smith and Blank are, and then see if you are willing to lower yourself to their level and enter a public canvass with them. 

It was my very thought! I did not sleep a single moment that night. But, after all, I could not recede. 

I was fully committed, and must go on with the fight. As I was looking listlessly over the papers at breakfast I came across this paragraph, and I may truly say I never was so confounded before. 

PERJURY.--Perhaps, now that Mr. Mark Twain is before the people as a candidate for Governor, he will condescend to explain how he came to be convicted of perjury by thirty-four witnesses in Wakawak, Cochin China, in 1863, the intent of which perjury being to rob a poor native widow and her helpless family of a meager plantain-patch, their only stay and support in their bereavement and desolation. Mr. Twain owes it to himself, as well as to the great people whose suffrages he asks, to clear this matter up. Will he do it? 

I thought I should burst with amazement! Such a cruel, heartless charge! I never had seen Cochin China! I never had heard of Wakawak! I didn't know a plantain-patch from a kangaroo! I did not know what to do. I was crazed and helpless. I let the day slip away without doing anything at all. The next morning the same paper had this--nothing more: 

SIGNIFICANT.--Mr. Twain, it will be observed, is suggestively silent about the Cochin China perjury. 

[Mem.--During the rest of the campaign this paper never referred to me in any other way than as "the infamous perjurer Twain."] 

Next came the Gazette, with this: 

WANTED TO KNOW.--Will the new candidate for Governor deign to explain to certain of his fellow-citizens (who are suffering to vote for him!) the little circumstance of his cabin-mates in Montana losing small valuables from time to time, until at last, these things having been invariably found on Mr. Twain's person or in his "trunk" (newspaper he rolled his traps in), they felt compelled to give him a friendly admonition for his own good, and so tarred and feathered him, and rode him on a rail; and then advised him to leave a permanent vacuum in the place he usually occupied in the camp. Will he do this? 

Could anything be more deliberately malicious than that? For I never was in Montana in my life. 

[After this, this journal customarily spoke of me as, "Twain, the Montana Thief."] 

I got to picking up papers apprehensively--much as one would lift a desired blanket which he had some idea might have a rattlesnake under it. One day this met my eye: 

THE LIE NAILED.--By the sworn affidavits of Michael O'Flanagan, Esq., of the Five Points, and Mr. Snub Rafferty and Mr. Catty Mulligan, of Water Street, it is established that Mr. Mark Twain's vile statement that the lamented grandfather of our noble standard- bearer, Blank J. Blank, was hanged for highway robbery, is a brutal and gratuitous LIE, without a shadow of foundation in fact. It is disheartening to virtuous men to see such shameful means resorted to to achieve political success as the attacking of the dead in their graves, and defiling their honored names with slander. When we think of the anguish this miserable falsehood must cause the innocent relatives and friends of the deceased, we are almost driven to incite an outraged and insulted public to summary and unlawful vengeance upon the traducer. But no! let us leave him to the agony of a lacerated conscience (though if passion should get the better of the public, and in its blind fury they should do the traducer bodily injury, it is but too obvious that no jury could convict and no court punish the perpetrators of the deed). 

The ingenious closing sentence had the effect of moving me out of bed with despatch that night, and out at the back door also, while the "outraged and insulted public" surged in the front way, breaking furniture and windows in their righteous indignation as they came, and taking off such property as they could carry when they went. And yet I can lay my hand upon the Book and say that I never slandered Mr. Blank's grandfather. More: I had never even heard of him or mentioned him up to that day and date. 

[I will state, in passing, that the journal above quoted from always referred to me afterward as "Twain, the Body-Snatcher."] 

The next newspaper article that attracted my attention was the following: 

A SWEET CANDIDATE.--Mr. Mark Twain, who was to make such a blighting speech at the mass-meeting of the Independents last night, didn't come to time! A telegram from his physician stated that he had been knocked down by a runaway team, and his leg broken in two places--sufferer lying in great agony, and so forth, and so forth, and a lot more bosh of the same sort. And the Independents tried hard to swallow the wretched subterfuge, and pretend that they did not know what was the real reason of the absence of the abandoned creature whom they denominate their standard-bearer. A certain man was seen to reel into Mr. Twain's hotel last night in a state of beastly intoxication. It is the imperative duty of the Independents to prove that this besotted brute was not Mark Twain himself. We have them at last! This is a case that admits of no shirking. The voice of the people demands in thunder tones, "WHO WAS THAT MAN?" 

It was incredible, absolutely incredible, for a moment, that it was really my name that was coupled with this disgraceful suspicion. Three long years had passed over my head since I had tasted ale, beer, wine or liquor or any kind. 

[It shows what effect the times were having on me when I say that I saw myself, confidently dubbed "Mr. Delirium Tremens Twain" in the next issue of that journal without a pang--notwithstanding I knew that with monotonous fidelity the paper would go on calling me so to the very end.] 

By this time anonymous letters were getting to be an important part of my mail matter. This form was common 

How about that old woman you kiked of your premises which was beging. POL. PRY. 

And this: 

There is things which you Have done which is unbeknown to anybody but me. You better trot out a few dots, to yours truly, or you'll hear through the papers from HANDY ANDY. 

This is about the idea. I could continue them till the reader was surfeited, if desirable. 

Shortly the principal Republican journal "convicted" me of wholesale bribery, and the leading Democratic paper "nailed" an aggravated case of blackmailing to me. 

[In this way I acquired two additional names: "Twain the Filthy Corruptionist" and "Twain the Loathsome Embracer."] 

By this time there had grown to be such a clamor for an "answer" to all the dreadful charges that were laid to me that the editors and leaders of my party said it would be political ruin for me to remain silent any longer. As if to make their appeal the more imperative, the following appeared in one of the papers the very next day: 

BEHOLD THE MAN!--The independent candidate still maintains silence. Because he dare not speak. Every accusation against him has been amply proved, and they have been indorsed and reindorsed by his own eloquent silence, till at this day he stands forever convicted. Look upon your candidate, Independents! Look upon the Infamous Perjurer! the Montana Thief! the Body-Snatcher! Contemplate your incarnate Delirium Tremens! your Filthy Corruptionist! your Loathsome Embracer! Gaze upon him--ponder him well--and then say if you can give your honest votes to a creature who has earned this dismal array of titles by his hideous crimes, and dares not open his mouth in denial of any one of them! 

There was no possible way of getting out of it, and so, in deep humiliation, I set about preparing to "answer" a mass of baseless charges and mean and wicked falsehoods. But I never finished the task, for the very next morning a paper came out with a new horror, a fresh malignity, and seriously charged me with burning a lunatic asylum with all its inmates, because it obstructed the view from my house. This threw me into a sort of panic. Then came the charge of poisoning my uncle to get his property, with an imperative demand that the grave should be opened. This drove me to the verge of distraction. On top of this I was accused of employing toothless and incompetent old relatives to prepare the food for the foundling' hospital when I warden. I was wavering--wavering. And at last, as a due and fitting climax to the shameless persecution that party rancor had inflicted upon me, nine little toddling children, of all shades of color and degrees of raggedness, were taught to rush onto the platform at a public meeting, and clasp me around the legs and call me PA!

I gave it up. I hauled down my colors and surrendered. I was not equal to the requirements of a Gubernatorial campaign in the state of New York, and so I sent in my withdrawal from the candidacy, and in bitterness of spirit signed it, "Truly yours, once a decent man, but now 

"MARK TWAIN, LP., M.T., B.S., D.T., F.C., and L.E."



#### 17.Lesson60 Too early and too late

Punctuality is a necessary habit in all public affairs in civilized society. Without it, nothing could ever be brought to a conclusion; everything would be in state of chaos. Only in a sparsely-populated rural community is it possible to disregard it. In ordinary living, there can be some tolerance of unpunctuality. The intellectual, who is working on some abstruse problem, has everything coordinated and organized for the matter in hand. He is therefore forgiven if late for a dinner party. But people are often reproached
for unpunctuality when their only fault is cutting things fine. It is hard for energetic, quick-minded people to waste time, so they are often tempted to finish a job before setting out to keep an appointment. If no accidents occur on the way, like punctured tyres, diversions of traffic, sudden descent of fog, they will be on time. They are often more industrious, useful citizens than those who are never late. The over-punctual can be as much a trial to others as the unpunctual. The guest who arrives half an hour too soon is the greatest nuisance. Some friends of my family had this irritating habit. The only thing to do was ask them to come half an hour later than the other guests. Then they arrived just when we wanted them.

If you are catching a train, it is always better to be comfortably early than even a fraction of a minute too late. Although being early may mean wasting a little time, this will be less than if you miss the train and have to wait an hour or more for the next one; and you avoid the frustration of arriving at the very moment when the train is drawing out of the station and being unable to get on it. An even harder situation is to be on the platform in good time for a train and still to see it go off without you. Such an experience befell a certain young girl the first time she was traveling alone. 

She entered the station twenty minutes before the train was due, since her parents had impressed upon her that it would be unforgivable to miss it and cause the friends with whom she was going to stay to make two journeys to meet her. She gave her luggage to a porter and showed him her ticket. To her horror he said that she was two hours too soon. She left  in her handbag for the piece of paper on which her father had written down all the details of the journey and gave it to the porter. He agreed that a train did come into the station at the time on the paper and that it did stop, but only to take on mail, not passengers. The girl asked to see a timetable, feeling sure that her father could not have made such a mistake. The porter went to fetch one and arrived back with the station master, who produced it with a flourish and pointed out a microscopic 'o' beside the time of the arrival of the train at his station; this little 'o' indicated that the train only stopped for mail. Just as that moment the train came into the station. The girl, tears streaming down her face, begged to be allowed to slip into the guard's van. But the station master was adamant: rules could not be broken. And she had to watch that train disappear towards her destination while she was left behind.



#### 18. 专8-2022年阅读理解text3

Vast stretches of central Asia feel eerily uninhabited.

Fly at 30,000 feet over the southern part of the former Soviet Union and there are long moments when no town or road or field is visible from your window.

The landscape of stark desert, trackless steppe, and rugged mountains seems to swallow up anything human.

It is little surprise, then, that this region remains largely unknown to most archaeologists.

Wandering bands and tribes roamed this immense area for 5,000 years, herding goat, sheep, cattle, and horses across immense steppes, through narrow valleys, and over high snowy passes.

They left occasional tombs that survived the ages, and on rare occasions settled down and built towns or even cities.

But for the most part, these people left behind few physical traces of their origins, beliefs, or ways of life.

What we know of these nomadic pastoralists comes mainly from their periodic forays into India, the Middle East, and China, where they often wreaked havoc and earned a fearsome reputation as enemies of urban life.

In the past century, scholars criticized these people as destructive, dismissed them as marginal, or, at best, cast them as a harsh tonic for restoring vigor to decaying and soft agricultural societies from ancient Mesopotamia to Imperial Rome to Han China.

In the 1950s, a British archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler blamed the aggressive, chariot-driving Aryans who swept in from the steppes for the demise of the peaceful Indus River civilization after 1800 B. C, though later archaeologists dismissed that claim.

But Michael Frachetti, a young archaeologist at Washington University in St. Louis, takes the radical view that Central Asians were early midwives in the birth of civilization rather than a destructive force.

Frachetti argues that ancient pastoralists living in the third millennium B. C, at the time of the first great cities of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and the Indus, created a network stretching across thousands of miles that passed along goods, technologies, and ideas central to urban life.

He believes they helped create civilization rather than hindering it.

Most archaeological work in Central Asia during the past century has focused on the open and rolling plains that stretch from the Black Sea to Manchuria.

These steppes only came to life after 2000 B. C. , when horse domestication and riding suddenly turned a forbidding landscape for pedestrians into a natural highway of grass.

By contrast, the areas to the south of the steppes have long been dismissed as backwaters of history.

In the past, these southern mountains and deserts were considered too remote, rugged, and inhospitable to have played a role in early migrations or the emergence of urban life.

The Karakum Desert, where it might rain once in a decade, covers nearly two-thirds of today's Turkmenistan, while the perpetually snow-covered Tian Shan Mountains of western China and eastern Kyrgyzstan soar 24,000 feet into the thin air.

It is there that Frachetti and a new generation of archaeologists from the United States and Central Asian nations are discovering evidence of a network of pastoralists who thrived centuries before hooves resounded on the steppes to the north.

These forgotten peoples may have carried such markers of civilization as ceramics and grains across thousands of miles, two millennia before the Silk Road linked the Roman Empire with Han China.

Frachetti argues that the new data emerging from the region force archaeologists to rethink their ideas about trade across Eurasia during the Bronze Age, when the first civilizations were taking form to the east, south, and west.

Frachetti, who has studied modern-day pastoralists in such unforgiving landscapes as the Sahara and Scandinavia, was drawn to the southern region of Central Asia for its environmental diversity of desert, grassland, and meadows.

Instead of a wasteland, he saw an ideal landscape for enterprising herders who wanted to pasture their animals in all seasons.

Together with his colleagues, Frachetti began digging a decade ago in the Dzhungar Mountains of Kazakhstan.

Covering nearly 500 square miles, this region lies between the Tian Shan and Alta Mountain ranges, and boasts sharp peaks topping 12,000 feet, as well as harsh desert.

At a site near a village called Begash, on a flat terrace enclosed by steep canyon walls alongside a small stream, the team uncovered the foundations of simple stone structures along with an array of potsherds and bronze and stone artifacts in stone-lined oval and rectangular tombs.

The earliest layers at Begash date to at least as early as 2500 B. C. , based on alpha magnetic spectrometry dating of organic remains, says Frachetti.

One woman was laid to rest with a bell-shaped hooked bronze earring around 1700 B. C. , according to electron spin resonance dating.

Similar earrings are only found several centuries later some 600 miles to the north on the Siberian steppes, hinting at styles that moved north over time.

More surprisingly, the excavators found wheat, which was first domesticated in the Fertile Crescent of the Middle East, and broomcorn millet that was first widely grown in northern China.

The grains were used ritually in a burial, and radiocarbon dating of the remains dates them to about 2200 B. C. , making them the oldest known domesticated grains in Central Asia.

The people of Begash may not have grown either grain — there are no grinding stones, a sign of grain preparation — but instead received it via trade networks stretching from the Near East to China.

Dorian Fuller, a leading expert in ancient grains based at University College London, calls the finds "important and well-dated."

He adds that Chinese crops such as millet began to appear in southwest Asia around 1900 B. C. , a few centuries after they reached Begash, which could mean the passage through the mountain regions was a means of gradual transmission from east to west.

Frachetti speculates that the grains may have been acquired from other tribes and used for ritual purposes, and then perhaps were passed on in turn to other pastoral peoples.

What makes the Begash discoveries so important is that previously this region was assumed to have been a land of scattered foragers until steppe peoples trickled down into the area's valleys and mountain ranges after 2000 B. C.

But it is becoming evident that the people of Begash were not simple foragers, but sophisticated pastoralists who tended their flocks, much as people in the area still do today.

The inhabitants did not begin to use horses until well into the second millennium B. C, and the varieties of sheep and goat found here today appear to be related to the varieties first domesticated thousands of years before in western Iran, near ancient Mesopotamia.

This indicates that Begash was "at the crossroads of extremely wide networks among Eurasian communities by the third millennium B. C," asserts Frachetti.

That doesn't mean that traders traversed thousands of miles in this early period.

Instead, the archaeologist envisions pastoralists taking their flocks to higher pastures in the summer, where they encountered neighbors from other valleys doing the same.

Thus, ideas and technologies might have passed gradually through the mountain corridors of southern Central Asia.

This corridor, Frachetti believes, may have been a key conduit for Bronze Age developments farther into East Asia and Mongolia.



#### 19. 国家地理 - 为什么旅行是一项人类的基本活动

I've been putting my passport to good use lately. I use it as a coaster and to level wobbly table legs. It makes an excellent cat toy.

Welcome to the pandemic of disappointments. Canceled trips, or ones never planned lest they be canceled. Family reunions, study-abroad years, lazy beach vacations. Poof. Gone. Obliterated by a tiny virus.

It is not natural for us to be this sedentary. Travel is in our genes. For most of the time our species has existed, "we've lived as nomadic hunter-gatherers moving about in small bands of 150 or fewer people," writes Christopher Ryan in Civilized to Death.

This nomadic life was no accident. It was useful. "Moving to a neighboring band is always an option to avoid brewing conflict or just for a change in social scenery," says Ryan.

Robert Louis Stevenson put it more succinctly: "The great affair is to move." What if we can't move, though? What if we're unable to hunt or gather? What's a traveler to do?

There are many ways to answer that question. "Despair," though, is not one of them. 

We are an adaptive species. We can tolerate brief periods of forced sedentariness. A dash of self-delusion helps. We're not grounded, we tell ourselves. We're merely between trips, like the unemployed salesman in between opportunities.

We pass the days thumbing through old travel journals and Instagram feeds. We gaze at souvenirs. All this helps. For a while. The travel industry is hurting. So are travelers.

"I dwelled so much on my disappointment that it almost physically hurt," Paris-based journalist Joelle Diderich told me recently, after canceling five trips last spring. My friend James Hopkins is a Buddhist living in Kathmandu.

You'd think he'd thrive during the lockdown, a sort-of mandatory meditation retreat. For a while he did. But during a recent Skype call, James looked haggard and dejected.

He was growing restless, he confessed, and longed "for the old 10-countries-a-year schedule." Nothing seemed to help, he told me. "No matter how many candles I lit, or how much incense I burned, and in spite of living in one of the most sacred places in South Asia, I just couldn't change my habits."

When we ended our call, I felt relieved, my grumpiness validated. It's not me; it's the pandemic. But I also worried. If a Buddhist in Kathmandu is going nuts, what hope do the rest of us stilled souls have?

I think hope lies in the very nature of travel. Travel entails wishful thinking. It demands a leap of faith, and of imagination, to board a plane for some faraway land, hoping, wishing, for a taste of the ineffable.

Travel is one of the few activities we engage in not knowing the outcome and reveling in that uncertainty. Nothing is more forgettable than the trip that goes exactly as planned.

Travel is not a rational activity. It makes no sense to squeeze yourself into an alleged seat only to be hurled at frightening speed to a distant place where you don't speak the language or know the customs.

All at great expense. If we stopped to do the cost-benefit analysis, we'd never go anywhere. Yet we do. That's one reason why I'm bullish on travel's future.

In fact, I'd argue travel is an essential industry, an essential activity. It's not essential the way hospitals and grocery stores are essential.

Travel is essential the way books and hugs are essential. Food for the soul. Right now, we're between courses, savoring where we've been, anticipating where we'll go.

Maybe it's Zanzibar and maybe it's the campground down the road that you've always wanted to visit.

It's not the place that is special but what we bring to it and, crucially, how we interact with it. Travel is not about the destination, or the journey.

It is about stumbling across "a new way of looking at things," as writer Henry Miller observed. We need not travel far to gain a fresh perspective.

No one knew this better than Henry David Thoreau, who lived nearly all of his too-short life in Concord, Massachusetts. There he observed Walden Pond from every conceivable vantage point: from a hilltop, on its shores, underwater.

Sometimes he'd even bend over and peer through his legs, marveling at the inverted world. "From the right point of view, every storm and every drop in it is a rainbow," he wrote.

Thoreau never tired of gazing at his beloved pond, nor have we outgrown the quiet beauty of our frumpy, analog world. If anything, the pandemic has rekindled our affection for it.

We've seen what an atomized, digital existence looks like, and we (most of us anyway) don't care for it. The bleachers at Chicago's Wrigley Field; the orchestra section at New York City's Lincoln Center; the alleyways of Tokyo.

We miss these places. We are creatures of place, and always will be. After the attacks of September 11, many predicted the end of air travel, or at least a dramatic reduction.

Yet the airlines rebounded steadily and by 2017 flew a record four billion passengers. Briefly deprived of the miracle of flight, we appreciated it more and today tolerate the inconvenience of body scans and pat-downs

for the privilege of transporting our flesh-and-bone selves to far-flung locations, where we break bread with other incarnate beings.

In our rush to return to the world, we should be mindful of the impact of mass tourism on the planet. Now is the time to embrace the fundamental values of sustainable tourism and let them guide your future journeys.

Go off the beaten path. Linger longer in destinations. Travel in the off-season. Connect with communities and spend your money in ways that support locals. Consider purchasing carbon offsets.

And remember that the whole point of getting out there is to embrace the differences that make the world so colorful. "One of the great benefits of travel is meeting new people and coming into contact with different points of view," says Pauline Frommer, travel expert and radio host.

So go ahead and plan that trip. Plotting a trip is nearly as enjoyable as actually taking one.

Anticipation is its own reward. I've witnessed first-hand the frisson of anticipatory travel.

My wife, not usually a fan of travel photos, now spends hours on Instagram, gazing longingly at photos of Alpine lodges and Balinese rice fields.

"What's going on?" I asked one day. "They're just absolutely captivating," she replied. "They make me remember that there is a big, beautiful world out there."

Many of us, me included, have taken travel for granted. We grew lazy and entitled, and that is never good. Tom Swick, a friend and travel writer, tells me he used to view travel as a given.

Now, he says, "I look forward to experiencing it as a gift."





#### 20. 经济学人 - 科技  AI音乐

In the dystopia of George Orwell's novel "1984", Big Brother numbs the masses with the help of a "versificator", a machine designed to automatically generate the lyrics to popular tunes, thereby ridding society of human creativity.

Today, numerous artificial-intelligence (AI) models churn out, some free of charge, the music itself. Unsurprisingly, many fear a world flooded with generic and emotionally barren tunes, with human musicians edged out in the process.

Yet there are brighter signs, too, that AI may well drive a boom in musical creativity.

AI music-making is nothing new. The first, so-called "rules-based", models date to the 1950s.

These were built by painstakingly translating principles of music theory into algorithmic instructions and probability tables to determine note and chord progressions.

The outputs were musically sound but creatively limited.

Ed Newton-Rex, an industry veteran who designed one such model for Jukedeck, a London firm he founded in 2012, describes that approach as good for the day but irrelevant now.

The clearest demonstration that times have changed came in August 2023.

That is when Meta, a social-media giant, released the source code for AudioCraft, a suite of large "generative" music models built using machine learning.

AI outfits worldwide promptly set about using Meta's software to train new music generators, many with additional code folded in.

One AudioCraft model, MusicGen, analysed patterns in some 400,000 recordings with a collective duration of almost 28 months to come up with 3.3bn "parameters", or variables, that enables the algorithm to generate patterns of sounds in response to prompts.

The space this creates for genuinely new AI compositions is unprecedented. Such models are also getting easier to use.

In September Stability AI, a firm based in London at which Mr Newton-Rex worked until recently, released a model, Stable Audio, trained on some 800,000 tracks.

Users guide it by entering text and audio clips. This makes it easy to upload, say, a guitar solo and have it recomposed in jazzy piano, perhaps with a vinyl playback feel.

Audio prompts are a big deal for two reasons, says Oliver Bown of Australia's University of New South Wales. First, even skilled musicians struggle to put music into words.

Second, because most musical training data are only cursorily tagged, even a large model may not understand a request for, say, a four-bar bridge in ragtime progression (the style familiar from Scott Joplin's "The Entertainer").

The potential, clearly, is vast. But many in the industry remain sceptical. One widespread sentiment is that AI will never produce true music.

That's because, as a musician friend recently told Yossef Adi, an engineer at Meta's AI lab in Tel Aviv, "no one broke its heart".

That may be true, but some AI firms reckon that they have found a way to retain and reproduce the "unique musical fingerprint" of their musician users, as LifeScore, a company founded near London, puts it.

LifeScore's AI limits itself to recomposing the elements of a user's original recordings in ways that maintain the music's feel, rather than turning them into something radically new.

It takes about a day to plug into LifeScore's model the dozens of individually recorded vocal and instrumental microphone tracks, or stems, that go into producing an original song.

Once that's done, however, the software, developed at a cost of some $10m, can rework each stem into a new tempo, key or genre within a couple of seconds.

The song's artists, present during the process, choose which remixes to keep. Manually remixing a hit track has traditionally taken one or more highly paid specialists weeks. 

LifeScore, says Tom Gruber, a co-founder, is "literally swamped with requests" from clients including Sony Music, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group.

An original release is typically turned into anywhere from a handful to a dozen remixes. But one client aims to release a dizzying 6,000 or so AI versions of an original track, each targeting a different market.

Artists including Pink Floyd's David Gilmour and Tom Gaebel, a German pop singer, use LifeScore's AI to power websites that allow fans to generate, with a few clicks, new remixes adapted to personal tastes.

If this seems like dizzying progress, it's worth noting that AI's impact on music is still in its early days. Legal uncertainties over the use of copyrighted recordings to train models have slowed development.

Outfits that have coughed up for licensing fees note that this can get expensive. To save on that cost, MusicGen's training set mostly sidestepped hits, says Dr Adi.

Though output is pretty good, he adds, the model is not yet "artistic enough" to generate narratively complete songs. Harmonic misalignments are common.

OpenAI, a San Francisco firm, for its part, says its MuseNet model struggles to pull off "odd pairings", such as a Chopin style that incorporates bass and drums.

In time, bigger training sets of better music will largely overcome such shortcomings, developers reckon.

A Stability AI spokesperson says that while Stable Audio's top duration for coherently structured music-"intro, development and outro"-is now about 90 seconds, upgrades will produce longer pieces with "full musicality".

But judging music AI by its ability to crank out polished tracks mostly misses the point. The technology's greatest promise, for now at least, lies elsewhere.

Part of it is the empowerment of amateurs. AI handles technical tasks beyond many people's capabilities and means. As a result, AI is drawing legions of newbies into music-making.

This is a boon for experimentation by what Simon Cross, head of products at Native Instruments, a firm based in Berlin, calls "bedroom producers".

Consider rx, a Native Instruments AI "assistant" that corrects errors in things like pitch and timing.

For the latter, software time-shifts notes by cutting out or inserting slivers of sound with matching timbre, a process called "dynamic time-warping".

The company's AI also determines what mixing and mastering processes were performed on a song of a user's choosing.

It then replicates, or at least approximates, the same expensive processing on the user's own creations.

Boomy, an online "music automation" platform for what Alex Mitchell, its ceo, describes as "low-friction" song production with text prompts, has more than 2m users.

The company, based in Berkeley, California, uploads users' (vetted) creations to streaming services and collects a cut of revenues.

AI serves professionals, too. The soundtracks to "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer" were cleaned up in post-production with rx, for example.

Another application area is "style transfer", in which models transform music recorded with one instrument into sounds that seem to come from a different one, often with a twist or two requested by the user.

Style transfers are also used for voice. A model developed by a startup in London called Voice-Swap slices up sounds sung by (remunerated) professional singers and rearranges the slivers into lyrics written by the service's users, who pay licensing fees for the rights to sell the resulting tracks.

And AI tools already exist to recreate singers' voices in other languages.

Vocaloid, a voice-synthesising tool from Yamaha, a Japanese instrument manufacturer, is one of many that can use a translation sung by a native speaker as a template for an AI to imitate as it rearranges, modifies and stitches together tiny snippets of the original singer's voice.

Accomplished musicians now widely tap MusicGen and its competitors as sources of "infinite inspirations", the better to alight upon promising composition ideas, says Meta's Dr Adi.

Whether such inspiration pays off will, ultimately, be up to the listener to decide.





#### 21. 经济学人 - 科技  让免疫系统睡个好觉

Give it a rest To ensure vaccines work properly, get a good night's sleep.

Vaccines get all the glory, but it is really the immune system that does the heavy lifting.

Indeed, those with weak immune systems often benefit little from vaccines.

Aware of this, researchers have long thought that people deprived of sleep also ought to benefit less from vaccines, as sleeping less is thought to reduce immune function.

A new analysis reveals that this is clearly the case-though only in men.

The immune system is metabolically expensive for the body to operate.

When resources run low, it cannot function as well as it might when well supported.

This is why people who are profoundly cold for long periods of time tend to fall ill- their bodies are burning calories to stay warm that might otherwise have been used to fuel their defence.

The immune system is similarly hamstrung by a lack of sleep since a number of its key components, such as the white blood cells that produce antibodies, are predominantly made by the body when a person is slumbering.

Yet it has remained unclear whether poor sleep at a time of vaccination leads to reduced immune benefits.

Vaccines work by presenting the immune system with the foreign material of a pathogen.

The system reacts by making antibodies, though these do not last for ever- they circulate in great numbers shortly after a real or vaccine-induced invasion but their population wanes over time.

Eventually, another shot of vaccine is needed to boost the antibody count.

For their study, Karine Spiegel at the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research and Eve Van Cauter at the University of Chicago speculated that insufficient sleep might damage the ability of the immune system to react to vaccines and thus result in fewer circulating antibodies.

They pooled the results of seven studies in which a total of 603 participants between the ages of 18 and 60 had had their antibody response to vaccines monitored and who had also been asked how many hours of sleep they were getting each night.

Dr Spiegel found that men showed a strong relationship between insufficient sleep (defined as fewer than six hours of kip a day) and antibody response.

The magnitude of the effect, when sleep duration was recorded objectively by a lab rather than self-reported by a patient, was similar to the amount of antibody waning seen in an average person two months after being given the Pfizer-BioNTech covid-19 jab.

The vaccines given to sleep-deprived men, therefore, still provided protection but the effect was less potent from the start and lasted for less time, on average.

The results were published this week in Current Biology.

Dr Spiegel says that encouraging patients to get plenty of sleep before and after a vaccination appointment is an ideal way for a medical system to maximise its vaccine stock and ensure that the benefits granted are as large as possible.

As for why the results in women were not significant, Dr Spiegel and her colleagues theorise that sleep affects female response to vaccines too but that hormone interference, driven by varying stages of the menstrual cycle, contraception and hormone-replacement therapies, is probably altering immune response in profound and unknown ways that throw off the results.

It is a subject area that urgently needs more attention, argue the researchers.

Vaccines are an important tool in the world's armoury against disease and there is no getting around the fact that developing and administering them is a difficult and expensive process.

But patients could at least be encouraged to give their immune system a rest before getting jabbed.

It costs nothing, and could pay considerable dividends.

How adult brains learn the new without forgetting the old.

Learning new things is hard.

Remembering what has already been learned is harder.

Any successful learning system, be it a brain or a piece of artificial-intelligence software, must strike the right balance between stability and flexibility.

It must be stable enough to remember important old things yet flexible enough to learn new ones without destroying old memory traces - preferably for as long as it exists.

Learning is a result of changes in the pattern of neural connectivity in the brain.

Each connection between nerve cells, called a synapse, is a tiny gap between the ends of branches ramifying from such cells.

Messages jump across these gaps in the form of molecules called neurotransmitters.

Current estimates suggest there are 600 trillion synapses in a human brain.

How, then, to deal with the stability-plasticity dilemma - particularly as brains age and, as it were, fill up?

Research by Dimitra Vardalaki, Kwanghun Chung and Mark Harnett at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, just published in Nature, suggests one way is to preserve into adulthood a type of memory-forming synapse found in children.

These are called silent synapses.

Silent synapses - which, as their name suggests, transmit no signal from one nerve cell to another - are often found on the ends of slender, immature protrusions from nerve cells, called filopodia.

Until now, it had been thought that these disappeared as a brain matured.

But Drs Vardalaki, Chung and Harnett have shown not only that they are present in adulthood, but also that they are common, at least in mice.

Just over a quarter of the connections they sampled in adult mouse visual cortices were silent synapses on filopodia.

And murine and human brains are sufficiently alike that something similar almost certainly applies to people.

To carry out their search for filopodia, the trio used a sensitive microscopy technique called eMAP.

They studied 2,234 synapses between cortical nerve cells of a type called pyramidal neurons, which have thousands of synapses each.

Peering through an emap microscope is enough to determine which cellular protrusions are filopodia.

But it cannot show which synapses on them are silent.

To do that, they needed to test how the filopodia responded to glutamate, the brain's main excitatory neurotransmitter.

First, they had to deliver a controlled flow of glutamate to the particular synapse they wanted to test.

To this end, they poured a soup of "caged" glutamate over the neuron under examination.

This form of the molecule is inert until hit with energy from the intersection of two laser beams.

Aiming those at the synapse under study enabled them to uncage the neurotransmitter and see, by measuring the electrical activity in that part of the neuron using an ultrafine electrode, whether the synapse responded.

They found that mature pyramidal-neuron protrusions generated electrical activity when exposed to glutamate, as expected.

Filopodia did not, confirming the silence of their synapses.

Silent synapses are, however, useless unless they can be switched on at the appropriate moment.

And the researchers confirmed this is possible.

They were able to induce the silent versions on filopodia to turn into mature, active synapses by pairing the simulated release of glutamate with a subsequent surge of electricity inside the neuron.

This pairing of events caused silent synapses to start, within minutes, displaying receptor molecules characteristic of active synapses.

The same pairing, applied to mature synapses, did nothing.

The researchers thereby show that it is hard to get a mature synapse to change the strength of its connection (thus satisfying the stability side of the dilemma), but easy to unsilence a silent one (satisfying the plasticity side).

The next thing to investigate is how, why and when new filopodia appear.

The discovery of all these eager-to-learn silent synapses and filopodia, Dr Harnett says, "is a lever for us to get into understanding learning in adults and how potentially we can get access to make it not degrade over the course of ageing or disease".



#### 23. Who’ s Who

It has never been explained why university students seem to enjoy practical jokes more than
anyone else. Students specialize in a particular type of practical joke: the hoax. Inviting the fire
brigade to put out a nonexistent fire is a crude form of deception which no self-respecting
student would ever indulge in. Students often create amusing situations which are funny to
everyone except the victims.

When a student recently saw two workmen using a pneumatic drill outside his university, he
immediately telephoned the police and informed them that two students dressed up as
workmen were tearing up the road with a pneumatic drill. As soon as he had hung up, he went
over to the workmen and told them that if a policeman ordered them to go away, they were not
to take him seriously. He added that a student had dressed up as a policeman and was playing all
sorts of silly jokes on people. Both the police and the workmen were grateful to the student for
this piece of advance information.

The student hid in an archway nearby where he could watch and hear everything that went on.
Sure enough, a policeman arrived on the scene and politely asked the workmen to go away.
When he received a very rude reply from one of the workmen, he threatened to remove them by
force. The workmen told him to do as he pleased and the policeman telephoned for help. Shortly
afterwards, four more policemen arrived and remonstrated with the workmen. As the men
refused to stop working, the police attempted to seize the pneumatic drill. The workmen
struggled fiercely and one of them lost his temper. He threatened to call the police. At this, the
police pointed out ironically that this would hardly be necessary as the men were already under
arrest. Pretending to speak seriously, one of the workmen asked if he might make a telephone
call before being taken to the station. Permission was granted and a policeman accompanied him
to a pay phone. Only when he saw that the man was actually telephoning the police did he realize
that they had all been the victims of a hoax.

#### 24. Illusions of Pastoral Peace

The quiet life of the country has never appealed to me. City born and city bred, I have always
regarded the country as something you look at through a train window, or something you
occasionally visit during the weekend. Most of my friends live in the city, yet they always go into
raptures at the mere mention of the country. Though they extol the virtues of the peaceful life,
only one of them has ever gone to live in the country and he was back in town within six months.
Even he still lives under the illusion that country life is somehow superior to town life. He is
forever talking about the friendly people, the clean atmosphere, the closeness to nature and the
gentle pace of living. Nothing can be compared, he maintains, with the first cock crow, the
twittering of birds at dawn, the sight of the rising sun glinting on the trees and pastures. This
idyllic pastoral scene is only part of the picture. My friend fails to mention the long and friendless
winter evenings in front of the TV —virtually the only form of entertainment. He says nothing about the poor selection of goods in the shops, or about those unfortunate people who have to travel from the country to the city every day to get to work. Why people are prepared to tolerate a four-hour journey each day for the dubious privilege of living in the country is beyond me. They could be saved so much misery and expense if they chose to live in the city where they rightly belong.

If you can do without the few pastoral pleasures of the country, you will find the city can provide
you with the best that life can offer. You never have to travel miles to see your friends. They
invariably live nearby and are always available for an informal chat or an evening ’ s
entertainment. Some of my acquaintances in the country come up to town once or twice a year
to visit the theatre as a special treat. For them this is a major operation which involves
considerable planning. As the play draws to its close, they wonder whether they will ever catch
that last train home. The city dweller never experiences anxieties of this sort. The latest
exhibitions, films, or plays are only a short bus ride away. Shopping, too, is always a pleasure.
There is so much variety that you never have to make do with second best. Country people run
wild when they go shopping in the city and stagger home loaded with as many of the exotic items as they can carry. Nor is the city without its moments of beauty. There is something comforting about the warm glow shed by advertisements on cold wet winter nights. Few things could be more impressive than the peace that descends on deserted city streets at weekends when the thousands that travel to work every day are tucked away in their homes in the country. It has always been a mystery to me why city dwellers, who appreciate all these things, obstinately pretend that they would prefer to live in the country.

#### 25. Modern Cavemen

Cave exploration, or pot-holing, as it has come to be known, is a relatively new sport. Perhaps it is
the desire for solitude or the chance of making an unexpected discovery that lures people down to
the depths of the earth. It is impossible to give a satisfactory explanation for a pot-holer’ s
motives. For him, caves have the same peculiar fascination which high mountains have for the
climber. They arouse instincts which can only be dimly understood.

Exploring really deep caves is not a task for the Sunday afternoon rambler. Such undertakings
require the precise planning and foresight of military operations. It can take as long as eight days
to rig up rope ladders and to establish supply bases before a descent can be made into a very
deep cave. Precautions of this sort are necessary, for it is impossible to foretell the exact nature
of the difficulties which will confront the pot-holer. The deepest known cave in the world is the
Gouffre Berger near Grenoble. It extends to a depth of 3,723 feet. This immense chasm has been
formed by an underground stream which has tunnelled a course through a flaw in the rocks. The
entrance to the cave is on a plateau in the Dauphiné Alps. As it is only six feet across, it is barely
noticeable. The cave might never have been discovered had not the entrance been spotted by
the distinguished French pot-holer, Berger. Since its discovery, it has become a sort of pot-holers’
Everest. Though a number of descents have been made, much of it still remains to be explored.

A team of pot-holers recently went down the Gouffre Berger. After entering the narrow gap on
the plateau, they climbed down the steep sides of the cave until they came to a narrow corridor.
They had to edge their way along this, sometimes wading across shallow streams, or swimming
across deep pools. Suddenly they came to a waterfall which dropped into an underground lake at
the bottom of the cave. They plunged into the lake, and after loading their gear on an inflatable
rubber dinghy, let the current carry them to the other side. To protect themselves from the icy
water, they had to wear special rubber suits. At the far end of the lake, they came to huge piles of
rubble which had been washed up by the water. In this part of the cave, they could hear an
insistent booming sound which they found was caused by a small waterspout shooting down
into a pool from the roof of the cave. Squeezing through a cleft in the rocks, the pot-holers arrived
at an enormous cavern, the size of a huge concert hall. After switching on powerful arc lights,
they saw great stalagmites—some of them over forty feet high —rising up like tree-trunks to
meet the stalactites suspended from the roof. Round about, piles of limestone glistened in all the
colours of the rainbow. In the eerie silence of the cavern, the only sound that could be heard was
made by water which dripped continuously from the high dome above them.

#### 26. Fully Insured

Insurance companies are normally willing to insure anything. Insuring public or private property is
a standard practice in most countries in the world. If, however, you were holding an open air
garden party or a fete it would be equally possible to insure yourself in the event of bad weather.
Needless to say, the bigger the risk an insurance company takes, the higher the premium you will
have to pay. It is not uncommon to hear that a shipping company has made a claim for the cost of
salvaging a sunken ship. But the claim made by a local authority to recover the cost of salvaging a
sunken pie dish must surely be unique.

Admittedly it was an unusual pie dish, for it was eighteen feet long and six feet wide. It had been
purchased by a local authority so that an enormous pie could be baked for an annual fair. The pie
committee decided that the best way to transport the dish would be by canal, so they insured it
for the trip. Shortly after it was launched, the pie committee went to a local inn to celebrate. At
the same time, a number of teenagers climbed on to the dish and held a little party of their own.
Modern dances proved to be more than the dish could bear, for during the party it capsized and
sank in seven feet of water.

The pie committee telephoned a local garage owner who arrived in a recovery truck to salvage
the pie dish. Shivering in their wet clothes, the teenagers looked on while three men dived
repeatedly into the water to locate the dish. They had little difficulty in finding it, but hauling it
out of the water proved to be a serious problem. The sides of the dish were so smooth that it was
almost impossible to attach hawsers and chains to the rim without damaging it. Eventually chains
were fixed to one end of the dish and a powerful winch was put into operation. The dish rose to
the surface and was gently drawn towards the canal bank. For one agonizing moment, the dish
was perched precariously on the bank of the canal, but it suddenly overbalanced and slid back
into the water. The men were now obliged to try once more. This time they fixed heavy metal
clamps to both sides of the dish so that they could fasten the chains. The dish now had to be
lifted vertically because one edge was resting against the side of the canal. The winch was again
put into operation and one of the men started up the truck. Several minutes later, the dish was
successfully hauled above the surface of the water. Water streamed in torrents over its sides with
such force that it set up a huge wave in the canal. There was a danger that the wave would
rebound off the other side of the bank and send the dish plunging into the water again. By
working at tremendous speed, the men managed to get the dish on to dry land before the wave
returned.

#### 27. Speed and Comfort

People travelling long distances frequently have to decide whether they would prefer to go by
land, sea, or air. Hardly anyone can positively enjoy sitting in a train for more than a few hours.
Train compartments soon get cramped and stuffy. It is almost impossible to take your mind off
the journey. Reading is only a partial solution, for the monotonous rhythm of the wheels clicking
on the rails soon lulls you to sleep. During the day, sleep comes in snatches. At night, when you
really wish to go to sleep, you rarely manage to do so. If you are lucky enough to get a sleeper,
you spend half the night staring at the small blue light in the ceiling, or fumbling to find your
ticket for inspection. Inevitably you arrive at your destination almost exhausted. Long car journeys are even less pleasant, for it is quite impossible even to read. On motorways you can, at least, travel fairly safely at high speeds, but more often than not, the greater part of the journey is spent on roads with few service stations and too much traffic. By comparison, ferry trips or cruises offer a great variety of civilized comforts. You can stretch your legs on the spacious decks, play games, swim, meet interesting people and enjoy good food—always assuming, of course, that the sea is calm. If it is not, and you are likely to get seasick, no form of transport could be worse. Even if you travel in ideal weather, sea journeys take a long time. Relatively few people are prepared to sacrifice holidays for the pleasure of travelling by sea.

Aeroplanes have the reputation of being dangerous and even hardened travellers are intimidated
by them. They also have the disadvantage of being an expensive form of transport. But nothing can match them for speed and comfort. Travelling at a height of 30,000 feet, far above the clouds, and at over 500 miles an hour is an exhilarating experience. You do not have to devise ways of taking your mind off the journey, for an aeroplane gets you to your destination rapidly. For a few hours, you settle back in a deep armchair to enjoy the flight. The real escapist can watch a film and sip champagne on some services. But even when such refinements are not available, there is plenty to keep you occupied. An aeroplane offers you an unusual and breathtaking view of the world. You soar effortlessly over high mountains and deep valleys. You really see the shape of the land. If the landscape is hidden from view, you can enjoy the extraordinary sight of unbroken cloud plains that stretch out for miles before you, while the sun shines brilliantly in a clear sky. The journey is so smooth that there is nothing to prevent you from reading or sleeping. However you decide to spend your time, one thing is certain: you will arrive at your destination fresh and uncrumpled. You will not have to spend the next few days recovering from a long and arduous journey.

#### 28. The Power of the Press

In democratic countries any efforts to restrict the freedom of the press are rightly condemned.
However, this freedom can easily be abused. Stories about people often attract far more public
attention than political events. Though we may enjoy reading about the lives of others, it is
extremely doubtful whether we would equally enjoy reading about ourselves. Acting on the
contention that facts are sacred, reporters can cause untold suffering to individuals by publishing
details about their private lives. Newspapers exert such tremendous influence that they can not
only bring about major changes to the lives of ordinary people but can even overthrow a
government.

The story of a poor family that acquired fame and fortune overnight, dramatically illustrates the
power of the press. The family lived in Aberdeen, a small town of 23,000 inhabitants in South
Dakota. As the parents had five children, life was a perpetual struggle against poverty. They were
expecting their sixth child and were faced with even more pressing economic problems. If they
had only had one more child, the fact would have passed unnoticed. They would have continued
to struggle against economic odds and would have lived in obscurity. But they suddenly became
the parents of quintuplets, four girls and a boy, an event which radically changed their lives. The
day after the birth of the five children, an aeroplane arrived in Aberdeen bringing sixty reporters
and photographers. 

The rise to fame was swift. Television cameras and newspapers carried the news to everyone in
the country. Newspapers and magazines offered the family huge sums for the exclusive rights to
publish stories and photographs. Gifts poured in not only from unknown people, but from baby
food and soap manufacturers who wished to advertise their products. The old farmhouse the
family lived in was to be replaced by a new $500,000 home. Reporters kept pressing for interviews so lawyers had to be employed to act as spokesmen for the family at press conferences.  While the five babies were still quietly sleeping in oxygen tents in a hospital nursery, their parents were paying the price for fame. It would never again be possible for them to lead normal lives. They had become the victims of commercialization, for their names had acquired a market value. Instead of being five new family member, these children had immediately become a commodity.



#### 29. Do It Yourself

So great is our passion for doing things for ourselves, that we are becoming increasingly less dependent on specialized labour. No one can plead ignorance of a subject any longer, for there are countless do-it-yourself publications. Armed with the right tools and materials, newlyweds gaily embark on the task of decorating their own homes. Men, particularly, spend hours of their leisure time installing their own fireplaces, laying out their own gardens; building garages and making furniture. Some really keen enthusiasts go so far as to build their own computers. Shops cater for the do-it-yourself craze not only by running special advisory services for novices, but by offering consumers bits and pieces which they can assemble at home. Such things provide an excellent outlet for pent up creative energy, but unfortunately not all of us are born handymen.

Some wives tend to believe that their husbands are infinitely resourceful and can fix anything. Even men who can hardly drive a nail in straight are supposed to be born electricians, carpenters, plumbers and mechanics. When lights fuse, furniture gets rickety, pipes get clogged, or vacuum cleaners fail to operate, some women assume that their husbands will somehow put things right. The worst thing about the do-it-yourself game is that sometimes even men live under the delusion that they can do anything, even when they have repeatedly been proved wrong. It is a question of pride as much as anything else.

Last spring my wife suggested that I call in a man to look at our lawn mower. It had broken down
the previous summer, and though I promised to repair it, I had never got round to it. I would not
hear of the suggestion and said that I would fix it myself. One Saturday afternoon, I hauled the
machine into the garden and had a close look at it. As far as I could see, it needed only a minor
adjustment: a turn of a screw here, a little tightening up there, a drop of oil and it would be as
good as new. Inevitably the repair job was not quite so simple. The mower firmly refused to mow,
so I decided to dismantle it. The garden was soon littered with chunks of metal which had once
made up a lawn mower. But I was extremely pleased with myself. I had traced the cause of the
trouble. One of the links in the chain that drives the wheels had snapped. After buying a new
chain I was faced with the insurmountable task of putting the confusing jigsaw puzzle together
again. I was not surprised to find that the machine still refused to work after I had reassembled it,
for the simple reason that I was left with several curiously shaped bits of metal which did not
seem to fit anywhere. I gave up in despair. The weeks passed and the grass grew. When my wife
nagged me to do something about it, I told her that either I would have to buy a new mower or
let the grass grow. Needless to say our house is now surrounded by a jungle. Buried somewhere
in deep grass there is a rusting lawn mower which I have promised to repair one day.

#### 30. Too high a price

Pollution is the price we pay for an overpopulated, over industrialized planet. When you come to think about it, there are only four ways you can deal with rubbish: dump it, burn it, turn it into something you can use again, attempt to produce less of it. We keep trying all four methods, but the sheer volume of rubbish we produce worldwide threatens to overwhelm us.

Rubbish, however, is only part of the problem of polluting our planet. The need to produce ever-increasing quantities of cheap food leads to a different kind of pollution. Industrialized farming methods produce cheap meat products: beef, pork and chicken. The use of pesticides and fertilizers produces cheap grain and vegetables. The price we pay for cheap food may be already too high: Mad Cow Disease (BSE) in cattle, salmonella in chicken and eggs, and listeria in dairy products. And if you think you'll abandon meat and become a vegetarian, you have the choice of very expensive organically-grown vegetables or a steady diet of pesticides every time you think you're eating fresh salads and vegetables, or just having an innocent glass of water!

However, there is an even more insidious kind of pollution that particularly affects urban areas and invades our daily lives, and that is noise. Burglar alarms going off at any time of the day or night serve only to annoy passers-by and actually assist burglars to burgle. Car alarms constantly scream at us in the street and are a source of profound irritation. A recent survey of the effects of noise revealed (surprisingly?) that dogs barking incessantly in the night rated the highest form of noise pollution on a scale ranging from 1 to 7. The survey revealed a large number of sources of noise that we really dislike. Lawn mowers whining on a summer's day, late-night parties in apartment blocks, noisy neighbors, vehicles of all kinds, especially large container trucks thundering through quiet villages, planes and helicopters flying overhead, large radios carried round in public places and played at maximum volume. New technology has also made its own contribution to noise. A lot of people object to mobile phones, especially when they are used in public places like restaurants or on public transport. Loud conversations on mobile phones invade our thoughts or interrupt the pleasure of meeting friends for a quiet chat. The noise pollution survey revealed a rather surprising and possibly amusing old-fashioned source of noise. It turned out to be snoring! Men were found to be the worst offenders. It was revealed that 20% of men in their mid-thirties snore. This figure rises to a staggering 60% of men in their sixties. Against these figures, it was found that only 5% of women snore regularly, while the rest are constantly woken or kept awake by their trumpeting partners. Whatever the source of noise, one thing is certain: silence, it seems, has become a golden memory.

#### 31. The Silent Village

In this much-travelled world, there are still thousands of places which are inaccessible to tourists.
We always assume that villagers in remote places are friendly and hospitable. But people who are
cut off not only from foreign tourists, but even from their own countrymen can be hostile to
travellers. Visits to really remote villages are seldom enjoyable—as my wife and I discovered
during a tour through the Balkans.

We had spent several days in a small town and visited a number of old churches in the vicinity.
These attracted many visitors, for they were not only of great architectural interest, but contained
a large number of beautifully preserved frescoes as well. On the day before our departure,
several bus loads of tourists descended on the town. This was more than we could bear, so we
decided to spend our last day exploring the countryside. Taking a path which led out of the town,
we crossed a few fields until we came to a dense wood. We expected the path to end abruptly,
but we found that it traced its way through the trees. We tramped through the wood for over
two hours until we arrived at a deep stream. We could see that the path continued on the other
side, but we had no idea how we could get across the stream. Suddenly my wife spotted a boat
moored to the bank. In it there was a boatman fast asleep. We gently woke him up and asked
him to ferry us to the other side. Though he was reluctant to do so at first, we eventually
persuaded him to take us.

The path led to a tiny village perched on the steep sides of a mountain. The place consisted of a straggling unmade road which was lined on either side by small houses. Even under a clear blue
sky, the village looked forbidding, as all the houses were built of grey mud bricks. The village seemed deserted, the only sign of life being an ugly-looking black goat on a short length of rope tied to a tree in a field nearby. Sitting down on a dilapidated wooden fence near the field, we opened a couple of tins of sardines and had a picnic lunch. All at once, I noticed that my wife seemed to be filled with alarm. Looking up I saw that we were surrounded by children in rags who were looking at us silently as we ate. We offered them food and spoke to them kindly, but they remained motionless. I concluded that they were simply shy of strangers. When we later walked down the main street of the village, we were followed by a silent procession of children. The village which had seemed deserted, immediately came to life. Faces appeared at windows. Men in shirt sleeves stood outside their houses and glared at us. Old women in black shawls peered at us from doorways. The most frightening thing of all was that not a sound could be
heard. There was no doubt that we were unwelcome visitors. We needed no further warning. Turning back down the main street, we quickened our pace and made our way rapidly towards the stream where we hoped the boatman was waiting.

#### 32. The Ideal Servant

It is a good thing my aunt Harriet died years ago. If she were alive today she would not be able to air her views on her favourite topic of conversation: domestic servants. Aunt Harriet lived in that leisurely age when servants were employed to do housework. She had a huge, rambling country house called“The Gables”. She was sentimentally attached to this house, for even though it was far too big for her needs, she persisted in living there long after her husband’ s death. Before she grew old, Aunt Harriet used to entertain lavishly. I often visited The Gables when I was a boy. No matter how many guests were present, the great house was always immaculate. The parquet floors shone like mirrors; highly polished silver was displayed in gleaming glass cabinets; even my uncle’ s huge collection of books was kept miraculously free from dust. Aunt Harriet presided over an invisible army of servants that continuously scrubbed, cleaned, and polished. She always referred to them as “the shifting population” , for they came and went with such frequency that I never even got a chance to learn their names. Though my aunt pursued what was, in those days, an enlightened policy, in that she never allowed her domestic staff to work more than eight hours a day, she was extremely difficult to please. While she always criticized the fickleness of human nature, she carried on an unrelenting search for the ideal servant to the end of her days, even after she had been sadly disillusioned by Bessie.

Bessie worked for Aunt Harriet for three years. During that time she so gained my aunt ’ s confidence, that she was put in charge of the domestic staff. Aunt Harriet could not find words to praise Bessie’ s industriousness and efficiency. In addition to all her other qualifications, Bessie was an expert cook. She acted the role of the perfect servant for three years before Aunt Harriet discovered her “ little weakness” . After being absent from The Gables for a week, my aunt unexpectedly returned one afternoon with a party of guests and instructed Bessie to prepare dinner. Not only was the meal well below the usual standard, but Bessie seemed unable to walk steadily. She bumped into the furniture and kept mumbling about the guests. When she came in with the last course—a huge pudding—she tripped on the carpet and the pudding went flying through the air, narrowly missed my aunt, and crashed on the dining table with considerable force. Though this caused great mirth among the guests, Aunt Harriet was horrified. She reluctantly came to the conclusion that Bessie was drunk. The guests had, of course, realized this from the moment Bessie opened the door for them and, long before the final catastrophe, had had a difficult time trying to conceal their amusement. The poor girl was dismissed instantly. After her departure, Aunt Harriet discovered that there were piles of empty wine bottles of all shapes and sizes neatly stacked in what had once been Bessie’ s wardrobe. They had mysteriously found their way there from the wine cellar!

#### 33. New Year resolutions

The New Year is a time for resolutions. Mentally, at least, most of us could compile formidable lists of“do’ s” and“don’ ts”. The same old favourites recur year in year out with monotonous regularity. We resolve to get up earlier each morning, eat less, find more time to play with the children, do a thousand and one jobs about the house, be nice to people we don’ t like, drive carefully, and take the dog for a walk every day. Past experience has taught us that certain accomplishments are beyond attainment. If we remain inveterate smokers, it is only because we have so often experienced the frustration that results from failure. Most of us fail in our efforts at self-improvement because our schemes are too ambitious and we never have time to carry them out. We also make the fundamental error of announcing our resolutions to everybody so that we look even more foolish when we slip back into our bad old ways. Aware of these pitfalls, this year I attempted to keep my resolutions to myself. I limited myself to two modest ambitions: to do physical exercises every morning and to read more of an evening. An all-night party on New Year’
s Eve, provided me with a good excuse for not carrying out either of these new resolutions on the first day of the year, but on the second, I applied myself assiduously to the task.

The daily exercises lasted only eleven minutes and I proposed to do them early in the morning before anyone had got up. The self-discipline required to drag myself out of bed eleven minutes earlier than usual was considerable. Nevertheless, I managed to creep down into the living room for two days before anyone found me out. After jumping about on the carpet and twisting the human frame into uncomfortable positions, I sat down at the breakfast table in an exhausted condition. It was this that betrayed me. The next morning the whole family trooped in to watch the performance. That was really unsettling, but I fended off the taunts and jibes of the family good-humouredly and soon everybody got used to the idea. However, my enthusiasm waned. The time I spent at exercises gradually diminished. Little by little the eleven minutes fell to zero. By January 10th, I was back to where I had started from. I argued that if I spent less time exhausting myself at exercises in the morning I would keep my mind fresh for reading when I got home from work. Resisting the hypnotizing effect of television, I sat in my room for a few evenings with my eyes glued to a book. One night, however, feeling cold and lonely, I went downstairs and sat in front of the television pretending to read. That proved to be my undoing, for I soon got back to my old bad habit of dozing off in front of the screen. I still haven’ t given up my resolution to do more reading. In fact, I have just bought a book entitled “ How to Read a Thousand Words a Minute”. Perhaps it will solve my problem, but I just haven’ t had time to read it!



#### 34. Predicting the future

Predicting the future is notoriously difficult. Who could have imagined, in the mid 1970s, for 
example, that by the end of the 20 th  century, computers would be as common in people’s home 
as TV sets? In the 1970s, computers were common enough, but only in big business, government 
departments, and large organizations. These were the so called mainframe machines. Mainframe 
computers were very large indeed, often occupying whole air‐conditioned rooms, employing 
full‐time technicians and run on specially‐written software. Though these large machines still 
exist, many of their functions have been taken over by small powerful computers, commonly 
known as PCs.

In 1975, a primitive machine called the Altair was launched in the USA. It can properly be 
described as the first ‘home computer’ and it pointed the way to the future. This was followed, at 
the end of the 1970s, by a machine called an Apple. In the early 1980s, the computer giant, IBM 
produced the world’s first Personal Computer. This ran on an ‘operating system’ called DOS, 
produced by a then small company named Microsoft. The IBM Personal Computer was widely 
copied. From those humble beginnings, we have seen the development of the user‐friendly 
home computers and multimedia machines which are in common use today. 

Considering how recent these developments are, it is even more remarkable that as long ago as the 1960s, an Englishman, Leon Bagrit, was able to predict some of the uses of computers which we know today. Bagrit dismissed the idea that computers would learn to ‘think’ for themselves and would ‘rule the world,’ which people liked  to believe in those days. Bagrit foresaw a time when computer would be small enough to hold in the hand, when they would be capable of providing information about traffic jams and suggesting alternative routes, when they would be used in hospitals to help doctors to diagnose illnesses, when they would relieve office workers and accountants of dull, repetitive clerical work. All these computer uses have become commonplaces. Of course, Leon Bagrit could not have foreseen the development of the Internet, the worldwide system that enables us to communicate instantly with anyone in any part of the world by using computers linked to telephone networks. Nor could he have foreseen how we could use the Internet to obtain information on every known subject, so we can read it on a screen in our homes and even print it as well if we want to. Computers have become smaller and smaller, more and more powerful and cheaper and cheaper. This is what makes Leon Bagrit’s prediction particularly remarkable. If he, or someone like him, were alive today, he might be able to tell us what to expect in the next fifty years. 

#### 35. Mud is Mud

My cousin, Harry, keeps a large curiously-shaped bottle on permanent display in his study. Despite the fact that the bottle is tinted a delicate shade of green, an observant visitor would soon notice that it is filled with what looks like a thick, greyish substance. If you were to ask Harry what was in the bottle, he would tell you that it contained perfumed mud. If you expressed doubt or surprise, he would immediately invite you to smell it and then to rub some into your skin. This brief experiment would dispel any further doubts you might have. The bottle really does contain perfumed mud. How Harry came into the possession of this outlandish stuff makes an interesting story which he is fond of relating. Furthermore, the acquisition of this bottle cured him of a bad habit he had been developing for years.

Harry used to consider it a great joke to go into expensive cosmetic shops and make outrageous requests for goods that do not exist. He would invent fanciful names on the spot. On entering a shop, he would ask for a new perfume called “Scented Shadow” or for “insoluble bath cubes”. If a shop assistant told him she had not heard of it, he would pretend to be considerably put out. He loved to be told that one of his imaginary products was temporarily out of stock and he would faithfully promise to call again at some future date, but of course he never did. How Harry managed to keep a straight face during these performances is quite beyond me.

Harry does not need to be prompted to explain how he bought his precious bottle of mud. One day, he went to an exclusive shop in London and asked for“Myrolite”. The shop assistant looked puzzled and Harry repeated the word, slowly stressing each syllable. When the woman shook her head in bewilderment, Harry went on to explain that “ myrolite ” was a hard, amber-like substance which could be used to remove freckles. This explanation evidently conveyed something to the woman who searched shelf after shelf. She produced all sorts of weird concoctions, but none of them met with Harry’ s requirements. When Harry put on his act of being mildly annoyed, the assisatnt promised to order some for him. Intoxicated by his success, Harry then asked for perfumed mud. He expected the assisatnt to look at him in blank astonishment. However, it was his turn to be surprised, for the woman’ s eyes immediately lit up and she fetched several bottles which she placed on the counter for Harry to inspect. For once, Harry had to admit defeat. He picked up what seemed to be the smallest bottle and discreetly asked the price. He was glad to get away with a mere twenty pounds and he beat a hasty retreat, clutching the precious bottle under his arm. From then on, Harry decided that this little game he had invented might prove to be expensive. The curious bottle, which now adorns the bookcase in his study was his first and last purchase of rare cosmetics.

#### 36. In the Public Interest

The Scandinavian countries are much admired all over the world for their enlightened social policies. Sweden has evolved an excellent system for protecting the individual citizen from high-handed or incompetent public officers. The system has worked so well, that it has been adopted in other countries too.

The Swedes were the first to recognize that public officials like civil servants, police officers, health inspectors or tax-collectors can make mistakes or act over-zealously in the belief that they are serving the public. As long ago as 1809, the Swedish Parliament introduced a scheme to safeguard the interest of the individual. A parliamentary committee representing all political parties appoints a person who is suitably qualified to investigate private grievances against the State. The official title of the person is “Justiteombudsman” , but the Swedes commonly refer to him as the “J.O.” or “Ombudsman” . The Ombudsman is not subject to political pressure. He investigates complaints large and small that come to him from all levels of society. As complaints must be made in writing, the Ombudsman receives an average of 1,200 letters a year. He has eight lawyer assistants to help him and he examines every single letter in detail. There is nothing secretive about the Ombudsman’ s work, for his correspondence is open to public inspection. If a citizen’ s complaint is justified, the Ombudsman will act on his behalf. The action he takes varies according to the nature of the complaint. He may gently reprimand an official or even suggest to parliament that a law be altered. The following case is a typical example of the Ombudsman’ s
work.

A foreigner living in a Swedish village wrote to the Ombudsman complaining that he had been ill-treated by the police, simply because he was a foreigner. The Ombudsman immediately wrote to the Chief of Police in the district asking him to send a record of the case. There was nothing in the record to show that the foreigner’ s complaint was justified and the Chief of Police strongly denied the accusation. It was impossible for the Ombudsman to take action, but when he received a similar complaint from another foreigner in the same village, he immediately sent one of his lawyers to investigate the matter. The lawyer ascertained that a policeman had indeed dealt roughly with foreigners on several occasions. The fact that the policeman was prejudiced against foreigners could not be recorded in the official files. It was only possible for the Ombudsman to find this out by sending one of his representatives to check the facts. The
policeman in question was severely reprimanded and was informed that if any further complaints were lodged against him, he would be prosecuted. The Ombudsman’ s prompt action at once put an end to an unpleasant practice which might have gone unnoticed.

#### 37. Instinct or cleverness

We have been brought up to fear insects. We regard them as unnecessary creatures that do more harm than good. We continually wage war on them, for they contaminate our food, carry diseases, or devour our crops. They sting or bite without provocation; they fly uninvited into our rooms on summer nights, or beat against our lighted windows. We live in dread not only of unpleasant insects like spiders or wasps, but of quite harmless ones like moths. Reading about them increases our understanding without dispelling our fears. Knowing that the industrious ant lives in a highly organized society does nothing to prevent us from being filled with revulsion when we find hordes of them crawling over a carefully prepared picnic lunch. No matter how much we like honey, or how much we have read about the uncanny sense of direction which bees possess, we have a horror of being stung. Most of our fears are unreasonable, but they are impossible to erase. At the same time, however, insects are strangely fascinating. We enjoy reading about them, especially when we find that, like the praying mantis, they lead perfectly horrible lives. We enjoy staring at them, entranced as they go about their business, unaware (we
hope) of our presence. Who has not stood in awe at the sight of a spider pouncing on a fly, or a column of ants triumphantly bearing home an enormous dead beetle?

Last summer I spent days in the garden watching thousands of ants crawling up the trunk of my prize peach tree. The tree has grown against a warm wall on a sheltered side of the house. I am especially proud of it, not only because it has survived several severe winters, but because it occasionally produces luscious peaches. During the summer, I noticed that the leaves of the tree were beginning to wither. Clusters of tiny insects called aphides were to be found on the underside of the leaves. They were visited by a large colony of ants which obtained a sort of honey from them. I immediately embarked on an experiment which, even though it failed to get rid of the ants, kept me fascinated for twenty-four hours. I bound the base of the tree with sticky tape, making it impossible for the ants to reach the aphides. The tape was so sticky that they did not dare to cross it. For a long time, I watched them scurrying around the base of the tree in bewilderment. I even went out at midnight with a torch and noted with satisfaction (and surprise) that the ants were still swarming around the sticky tape without being able to do anything about it. I got up early next morning hoping to find that the ants had given up in despair. Instead, I saw
that they had discovered a new route. They were climbing up the wall of the house and then on to the leaves of the tree. I realized sadly that I had been completely defeated by their ingenuity. The ants had been quick to find an answer to my thoroughly unscientific methods!

#### 38. From the Earth: Greetings

Recent developments in astronomy have made it possible to detect planets in our own Milky Way and in other galaxies. This is a major achievement because, in relative terms, planets are very small and do not emit light. Finding planets is proving hard enough, but finding life on them will prove infinitely more difficult. The first question to answer is whether a planet can actually support life. In our own solar
system, for example, Venus is far too hot and Mars is far too cold to support life. Only the Earth provides ideal conditions, and even here it has taken more than four billion years for plant and animal life to evolve.

Whether a planet can support life depends on the size and brightness of its star, that is its 'sun'. Imagine a star up to twenty times larger, brighter and hotter than our own sun. A planet would have to be a very long way from it to be capable of supporting life. Alternatively, if the star were small, the life-supporting planet would have to have a close orbit round it and also provide the perfect conditions for life forms to develop. But how would we find such a planet? At present, there is no telescope in existence that is capable of detecting the presence of life. The development of such a telescope will be one of the great astronomical projects of the twenty-first century.

It is impossible to look for life on another planet using earth-based telescopes. Our own warm atmosphere and the heat generated by the telescope would make it impossible to detect objects as small as planets. Even a telescope in orbit round the earth, like the very successful Hubble telescope, would not be suitable because of the dust particles in our solar system. A telescope would have to be as far away
as the planet Jupiter to look for life in outer space, because the dust becomes thinner the further we travel towards the outer edges of our own solar system. Once we detected a planet, we would have to find a way of blotting out the light from its star, so that we would be able to 'see' the planet properly and analyse its atmosphere. In the first instance, we would be looking for plant life, rather than 'little green
men'. The life forms most likely to develop on a planet would be bacteria. It is bacteria that have generated the oxygen we breathe on earth. For most of the earth's history they have been the only form of life on our planet. As Earth-dwellers, we always cherish the hope that we will be visited by little green men and that we will be able to communicate with them. But this hope is always in the realms of science
fiction. If we were able to discover lowly forms of life like bacteria on another planet, it would completely change our view of ourselves. As Daniel Goldin of NASA observed, 'Finding life elsewhere would change everything. No human endeavour or thought would be unchanged by it."



#### 39. Our neighbour, the river

The river which forms the eastern boundary of our farm has always played an important part in our lives. Without it we could not make a living. There is only enough spring water to supply the needs of the house, so we have to pump from the river for farm use. We tell the river all our secrets. We know instinctively, just as beekeepers with their bees, that misfortune might overtake us if the important events of our lives were not related to it. 

We have special river birthday parties in the summer. Sometimes we go upstream to a favourite backwater, sometimes we have our party at the boathouse, which a predecessor of ours at the farm built in the meadow hard by the deepest pool for swimming and diving. In a heatwave we choose a midnight birthday party and that is the most exciting of all. We welcome the seasons by the riverside, crowning the youngest girl with flowers in the spring, holding a summer festival on Midsummer Eve, giving thanks for the harvest in the autumn, and throwing a holly wreath into the current in the winter.

After a long period of rain the river may overflow its banks. This is a rare occurrence as our climate seldom goes to extremes. We are lucky in that only the lower fields, which make up a very small proportion of our farm, are affected by flooding, but other farms are less favourably sited, and flooding can sometimes spell disaster for their owners.

One bad winter we watched the river creep up the lower meadows. All the cattle had been moved into stalls and we stood to lose little. We were, however, worried about our nearest neighbours, whose farm was low lying and who were newcomers to the district. As the floods had put the telephone out of order, we could not find out how they were managing. From an attic window we could get a sweeping view of the river where their land joined ours, and at the most critical juncture we took turns in watching that point. The first sign of disaster was a dead sheep floating down. Next came a horse, swimming bravely, but we were afraid that the strength of the current would prevent its landing anywhere before it became exhausted. Suddenly a raft appeared, looking rather like Noah’ s ark, carrying the whole family, a few hens, the dogs, a cat, and a bird in a cage. We realized that they must have become unduly frightened by the rising flood, for their house, which had sound foundations, would have stood stoutly even if it had been almost submerged. The men of our family waded down through our flooded meadows with
boathooks, in the hope of being able to grapple a corner of the raft and pull it out of the current towards our bank. We still think it a miracle that they were able to do so.



#### 40. Back in the old country

I stopped to let the car cool off and to study the map. I had expected to be near my objective by now, but everything still seemed alien to me. I was only five when my father had taken me abroad, and that was eighteen years ago. When my mother had died after a tragic accident, he did not quickly recover from the shock and loneliness. Everything around him was full of her presence, continually reopening the wound. So he decided to emigrate. In the new country he became absorbed in making a new life for the two of us, so that he gradually ceased to grieve. He did not marry again and I was brought up without a woman’ s care; but I lacked for nothing, for he was both father and mother to me. He always meant to go back one day, but not to stay. His roots and mine had become too firmly embedded in the new land. But he wanted to see the old folk again and to visit my mother’ s grave. He became mortally ill a few months before we had planned to go and, when he knew that he was dying, he made me promise to go on my own.

I hired a car the day after landing and bought a comprehensive book of maps, which I found most helpful on the cross-country journey, but which I did not think I should need on the last stage. It was not that I actually remembered anything at all. But my father had described over and over again what we should see at every milestone, after leaving the nearest town, so that I was positive I should recognize it as familiar territory. Well, I had been wrong, for I was now lost.

I looked at the map and then at the milometer. I had come ten miles since leaving the town, and at this point, according to my father, I should be looking at farms and cottages in a valley, with the spire of the church of our village showing in the far distance. I could see no valley, no farms, no cottages and no church spire—only a lake. I decided that I must have taken a wrong turning somewhere. So I drove back to the town and began to retrace the route, taking frequent glances at the map. I landed up at the same corner. The curious thing was that the lake was not marked on the map. I felt as if I had stumbled into a nightmare country, as you sometimes do in dreams. And, as in a nightmare, there was nobody in sight to help me. Fortunately for me, as I was wondering what to do next, there appeared on the horizon a man on horseback, riding in my direction. I waited till he came near, then I asked him the way to our old village. He said that there was now no village. I thought he must have misunderstood me, so I repeated its name. This time he pointed to the lake. The village no longer existed because it had been submerged, and all the valley too. The lake was not a natural one, but a man-made reservoir.



#### 41. A spot of bother

The old lady was glad to be back at the block of flats where she lived. Her shopping had tired her and her basket had grown heavier with every step of the way home. In the lift her thoughts were on lunch and a good rest; but when she got out at her own floor, both were forgotten in her sudden discovery that her front door was open. She was thinking that she must reprimand her home help the next morning for such a monstrous piece of negligence, when she remembered that she had gone shopping after the home help had left and she knew that she had turned both keys in their locks. She walked slowly into the hall and at once noticed that all the room doors were open, yet following her regular practice she had shut them before going out. Looking into the drawing room, she saw a scene of confusion over by her writing desk. It was as clear as daylight then that burglars had forced an entry during her absence. Her first impulse was to go round all the rooms looking for the thieves, but then she decided that at her age it might be more prudent to have someone with her, so she went to fetch the porter from his basement. By this time her legs were beginning to tremble, so she sat down and accepted a cup of very strong tea, while he telephoned the police. Then, her composure regained, she was ready to set off with the porter’ s assistance to search for any intruders who might still be lurking in her flat.

They went through the rooms, being careful to touch nothing, as they did not want to hinder the police in their search for fingerprints. The chaos was inconceivable. She had lived in the flat for thirty years and was a veritable magpie at hoarding; and it seemed as though everything she possessed had been tossed out and turned over and over. At least sorting out the things she should have discarded years ago was now being made easier for her. Then a police inspector arrived with a constable and she told them of her discovery of the ransacked flat. The inspector began to look for fingerprints, while the constable checked that the front door locks had not been forced, thereby proving that the burglars had either used skeleton keys or entered over the balcony. There was no trace of fingerprints, but the inspector found a dirty red bundle that contained jewellery which the old lady said was not hers. So their entry into this flat was
apparently not the burglars’ first job that day and they must have been disturbed. The inspector then asked the old lady to try to check what was missing by the next day and advised her not to stay alone in the flat for a few nights. The old lady thought he was a fussy creature, but since the porter agreed with him, she rang up her daughter and asked for her help in what she described as a little spot of bother.



#### 42. Collecting

People tend to amass possessions, sometimes without being aware of doing so. Indeed they can have a delightful surprise when they find something useful which they did not know they owned. Those who never have to move house become indiscriminate collectors of what can only be described as clutter. They leave unwanted objects in drawers, cupboards and attics for years, in the belief that they may one day need just those very things. As they grow old, people also accumulate belongings for two other reasons, lack of physical and mental energy, both of which are essential in turning out and throwing away, and sentiment. Things owned for a long time are full of associations with the past, perhaps with relatives who are dead, and so they gradually acquire a value beyond their true worth.

Some things are collected deliberately in the home in an attempt to avoid waste. Among these I would list string and brown paper, kept by thrifty people when a parcel has been opened, to save buying these two requisites. Collecting small items can easily become a mania. I know someone who always cuts sketches  out from newspapers of model clothes that she would like to buy, if she had the money. As she is not rich, the chances that she will ever be able to afford such purchases are remote; but she is never sufficiently strong-minded to be able to stop the practice. It is a harmless habit, but it litters up her desk to such an extent that every time she opens it, loose bits of paper fall out in every direction.

Collecting as a serious hobby is quite different and has many advantages. It provides relaxation for leisure hours, as just looking at one’ s treasures is always a joy. One does not have to go outside for amusement, since the collection is housed at home. Whatever it consists of, stamps, records, first editions of books, china, glass, antique furniture, pictures, model cars, stuffed birds, toy animals, there is always something to do in connection with it, from finding the right place for the latest addition, to verifying facts in reference books. This hobby educates one not only in the chosen subject, but also in general matters which have some bearing on it. There are also other benefits. One wants to meet like-minded collectors, to get advice, to compare notes, to exchange articles, to show off the latest find. So one’ s circle of friends grows. Soon the hobby leads to travel, perhaps to a meeting in another town, possibly a trip abroad in search of a rare specimen, for collectors are not confined to any one country. Over the years one may well become an authority on one ’ s hobby and will very probably be asked to give informal talks to little gatherings and then, if successful, to larger audiences. In this way self-confidence grows, first from mastering a subject, then from being able to talk about it. Collecting, by occupying spare time so constructively, makes a person contented, with no time for boredom.



#### 43. The persistence and peril of misinformation

*Brian Southwell looks at how human brains verify information and discusses some of the challenges of battling widespread falsehoods*

 

Misinformation – both deliberately promoted and accidentally shared – is perhaps an inevitable part of the world in which we live, but it is not a new problem. People likely have lied to one another for roughly as long as verbal communication has existed. Deceiving others can offer an apparent opportunity to gain strategic advantage, to motivate others to action, or even to protect interpersonal bonds. Moreover, people inadvertently have been sharing inaccurate information with one another for thousands of years.

However, we currently live in an era in which technology enables information to reach large audiences distributed across the globe, and thus the potential for immediate and widespread effects from misinformation now looms larger than in the past. Yet the means to correct misinformation might, over time, be found in those same patterns of mass communication and of the facilitated spread of information.

The main worry regarding misinformation is its potential to unduly influence attitudes and behavior, leading people to think and act differently than they would if they were correctly informed, as suggested by the research teams of Stephan Lewandowsky of the University of Bristol and Elizabeth Marsh of Duke University, among others. In other words, we worry that misinformation might lead people to hold misperceptions (or false beliefs) and that these misperceptions, especially when they occur among large groups of people, may have detrimental, downstream consequences for health, social harmony, and the political climate.

At least three observations related to misinformation in the contemporary mass-media environment warrant the attention of researchers, policy makers, and really everyone who watches television, listens to the radio, or reads information online. First of all, people who encounter misinformation tend to believe it, at least initially. Secondly, electronic and print media often do not block many types of misinformation before it appears in content available to large audiences. Thirdly, countering misinformation once it has enjoyed wide exposure can be a resource-intensive effort.

Knowing what happens when people initially encounter misinformation holds tremendous importance for estimating the potential for subsequent problems. Although it is fairly routine for individuals to come across information that is false, the question of exactly how – and when – we mentally label information as true or false has garnered philosophical debate. The dilemma is neatly summarized by a contrast between how the 17th-century philosophers René Descartes and Baruch Spinoza described human information engagement, with conflicting predictions that only recently have been empirically tested in robust ways. Descartes argued that a person only accepts or rejects information after considering its truth or falsehood; Spinoza argued that people accept all encountered information (or misinformation) by default and then subsequently verify or reject it through a separate cognitive process. In recent decades, empirical evidence from the research teams of Erik Asp of the University of Chicago and Daniel Gilbert at Harvard University, among others, has supported Spinoza's account: people appear to encode all new information as if it were true, even if only momentarily, and later tag the information as being either true or false, a pattern that seems consistent with the observation that mental resources for skepticism physically reside in a different part of the brain than the resources used in perceiving and encoding.

What about our second observation that misinformation often can appear in electronic or print media without being preemptively blocked? In support of this, one might consider the nature of regulatory structures in the United States: regulatory agencies here tend to focus on post hoc detection of broadcast information. Organizations such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) offer considerable monitoring and notification functions, but these roles typically do not involve preemptive censoring. The FDA oversees direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertising, for example, and has developed mechanisms such as the 'Bad Ad' program, through which people can report advertising in apparent violation of FDA guidelines on drug risks. Such programs, although laudable and useful, do not keep false advertising off the airwaves. In addition, even misinformation that is successfully corrected can continue to affect attitudes.

This leads us to our third observation: a campaign to correct misinformation, even if rhetorically compelling, requires resources and planning to accomplish necessary reach and frequency. For corrective campaigns to be persuasive, audiences need to be able to comprehend them, which requires either effort to frame messages in ways that are accessible or effort to educate and sensitize audiences to the possibility of misinformation. That some audiences might be unaware of the potential for misinformation also suggests the utility of media literacy efforts as early as elementary school. Even with journalists and scholars pointing to the phenomenon of 'fake news', people do not distinguish between demonstrably false stories and those based in fact when scanning and processing written information.

We live at a time when widespread misinformation is common. Yet at this time many people also are passionately developing potential solutions and remedies. The journey forward undoubtedly will be a long and arduous one. Future remedies will require not only continued theoretical consideration but also the development and maintenance of consistent monitoring tools – and a recognition among fellow members of society that claims which find prominence in the media that are insufficiently based in scientific consensus and social reality should be countered. Misinformation arises as a result of human fallibility and human information needs. To overcome the worst effects of the phenomenon, we will need coordinated efforts over time, rather than any singular one-time panacea we could hope to offer.




#### 44. The sculptor speaks
Appreciation of sculpture depends upon the ability to respond to form in there dimension. That is perhaps why sculpture has been described as the most difficult of all arts; certainly it is more difficult than the arts which involve appreciation of flat forms， shape in only two dimensions. Many more people are 'form-blind' than colour-blind. The child learning to see， first distinguishes only two-dimensional shape; it cannot judge distances， depths. Later， for its personal safety and practical needs， it has to develop (partly by means of touch) the ability to judge roughly three-dimensonal distances. But having satisfied the requirements of practical necessity， most people go no further. Though they may attain considerable accuracy in the perception of flat from， they do no make the further. Though they may attain considerable accuracy in the perception of flat form， they do not make the further intellectual and emotional effort needed to comprehend form in its full spatial existence.

　　This is what the sculptor must do. He must strive continually to think of， and use， form in its full spatial completeness. He gets the solid shape， as it were， inside his head-he thinks of it， whatever its size， as if he were holding it completely enclosed in the hollow of his hand. He mentally visualizes a complex form from all round itself; he knows while he looks at one side what the other side is like;  he identifies himself with its centre of gravity， its mass， its weight; he realizes its volume， as the space that the shape displaces in the air.

　　And the sensitive observer of sculpture must also learn to feel shape simply as shape， not as desc ription or reminiscence. He must， for example， perceive an egg as a simple single solid shape， quite apart from its significance as food， or from the literary idea that it will become a bird. And so with solids such as a shell， a nut， a plum， a pear， a tadpole， a mushroom， a mountain peak， a kidney， a carrot， a tree-trunk， a bird， a bud， a lark， a ladybird， a bulrush， a bone. From these he can go on to appreciate more complex forms of combinations of several forms.



#### 45. The Dinner Party

I first heard this tale in India, where is told as if true -- though any naturalist would know it couldn't be. Later someone told me that the story appeared in a magazine shortly before the First World War.That magazine story,and the person who wrote it,I have never been able to track down.

The country is India. A colonial official and his wife are giving a large dinner party.They are seated with their guests --officers and their wives,and a visiting American naturalist -- in their spacious ding room, which has a bare marble floor, open rafters and wide glass doors opening onto a veranda.

A spirited discussion springs up between a young girl who says that women have outgrown the jumping-on-a-chair-at-the-sight-of-a-mouse era and a major who says that they haven't.

"A woman's reaction in any cris," the major says, "is to scream. And while a manmay feel like it, he has that ounce more of control than a woman has. And that last ounce is what really counts."

  he quickly leaves the room.

Of the guests, none except the American notices this or sees the boy place a bowl of milk on the veranda just outside the open doors.

 

 "Iwant to know just what control everyone at this table has.I will count three hundred -- that's five minutes -- and not one of you is to move a muscle. Those who move will forfeit 50 rupees. Ready?"

The 20 people sit like stone images while he counts. He is saying "...two hundred and eighty..." when, out of the corner of his eye, he sees the cobra emerge and make for the 

bowl of milk. Screams ring out as he jumps to slam the veranda doors safely shut.

"You were right, Major!" the host exclaims. "A man has just shown us an example ofperfect self-control."

"Just a minute," the American says, turning to his hostess. "Mrs. Wynnes, how did youknow that cobra was in the room?"

A faint smile lights up the woman's face as she replies:

 "Because it was crawling across my foot."





#### 46. An Important Lesson

It was an early September day, cool and bright and just right for running, and I was in the first few miles of a 10-mile race over a course with a few high hills. Still, I felt energetic; despite the hills it was going to be a fine run.

　　Just ahead of me was Peggy Mimno, a teacher from Mount Kisco, New York. She too was running easily, moving along at my speed. The pace felt comfortable, so I decided to stay where I was; why pay attention to pace when she was setting such a nice one? I'd overtake her later on when she tired.

　　So I ran behind her. The course headed north for five miles, wandered west for a hilly mile, then turned south again along a winding road. The race was getting harder. We had four miles left and already it was beginning to be real work.

　　Peggy overtook a young runner. She seemed to know him, for they exchanged a few cheerful words as she passed him. Their exchange worried me. You don't chat during a race unless you are feeling good, and Peggy plainly was.

　　Still, I was close enough to overtake her if she tired, so I didn't give up hope completely. We were getting nearer to a long, punishing hill now and it would be the test. We were a mile from the finish line, so whatever happened on the hill would almost certainly determine who crossed it first.

　　As I moved up the hill, my attention wandered for a few minutes. When I looked up. Peggy was moving away -- first five yards, then ten, then more. Finally it was clear that there was no hope of catching her. She beat me soundly.

　　There is an important lesson in that race. Women are thought to be weaker, slower and not nearly as skilled in sport. Yet as Peggy Mimmo so clearly showed, the similarities between men and women runners are more important than the differences. I have run with a number of women, and I can say that it is often hard work.





#### 47. Lessons from Jefferson

Thomas Jefferson,the third president of the United States,may be less famous than George Washington and Abraham Lincoln,but most people remember at least one fact about him:he wrote the Declaration of Independence.

Although Jefferson lived more than 200 years ago, there is much that we can learn from him today.many of his ideas are especially interesting to modern youth. Here are some of the things he said and wrote.

Go and see. 
Jefferson believed that a free man obtains knowledge from many sources besides books and that personal investigation is important. When still a young man, he was appointed to a committee to find out whether the South Branch of the James River was deep enough to be used by large boats. While the other members of the committee sat in the state capitol and studied papers on the subject, Jefferson got into a canoe and made on-the-spot observations.

You can learn from everyone. 
By birth and education Jefferson belonged to the highest social class. Yet, in a day when few noble persons ever spoke to those of humble origins except to give an order, Jefferson went out of his way to talk with gardeners, servants,and waiters. Jefferson once said to the French nobleman, Lafayette, "You must go into the people's homes as I have done ,look into their cooking pots and eat their bread. If you will only do this , You may find out why people are dissatisfied and understand the revolution that is threatening France."

Judge for yourself. 
Jefferson refused to accept other people's option's without careful thought. "Neither belive nor reject anything ,"he wrote to his nephew, "because any other person has rejected or believed it. Heaven has given you a mind for judging truth and error. Use it." Jefferson felt that the people "may safely be trusted to hear everything true and false,and to from a correct judgment. Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter."

Do what you believed is right.
In a free country there will always be conflicting ideas, and this is a source of strength. It is conflict and not unquestioning agreement that keeps freedom alive. Though Jefferson was for many years the object of strong criticism, he never answered his critics. He expressed his philosophy in letters to a friend, "there are two sides to every question. If you take one side with decision and act on it with effect, those who take the other side will of course resent yours action."

Trust the future; trust the young.
Jefferson felt that the present should never be chained to customs which have lost their usefulness "no society ,"he said."can make a perpetual constitution, or even a perpetual law. The earth belongs to the living generation." He did not fear new ideas, nor did he fear the future. "How much pain," he remarked, "has been caused by evils which have never happened! I expected the best, not the worst. I steer my ship with hope, leaving fear behind."

Jefferson's courage and idealism were based on knowledge. He probably knew more than any other man of his age. He was an expert in agriculture, archeology, and medicine. He practiced crop rotation and soil conservation a century before these became standard  practice, and he invented a plow  superior to any other in existence. He influenced architecture throughout America, and he was constantly producing devices for making the tasks of ordinary life easier to perform.

Of all Jefferson's many talents, one is central. He was above all a good and tireless writer. His complete works, now being published for the first time, will fill more than fifty volumes. His talent as an author was soon discoverred, and when the time came to write the Declaration of Independence at Philadelphia in 1776, the task of writing it was his. Millions have thrilled to his words: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal ..."

When Jefferson died on July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of American independence, he left his countrymen a rich legacy of ideas and examples. American education owes a great debt to Thomas Jefferson, Who believed that only a nation of educated people could remain free.



#### 48. My first job

While I was waiting to enter university, I saw advertised in a local newspaper a teaching post at a school in a suburb of London about ten miles from where I lived. Being very short money and wanting to do something useful, I applied, fearing as I did so, that without a degree and with no experience in teaching my chances of getting the job were slim.

However, three days later a letter arrived, asking me to go to Croydon for an interview. It proved an awkward journey: a train to Croydon station; a ten-minute bus ride and then a walk of at least a quarter of a mile. As a result I arrived on a hot June morning too depressed to feel nervous. 

The school was a red brick house with big windows. The front garden was a gravel square; four evergreen shrubs stood at each corner, where they struggled to survive the dust and fumes from a busy main road.

It was clearly the headmaster himself that opened the door. He was short and fat. He had a sandy-coloured moustache, a wrinkled forehead and hardly any hair.

He looked at me with an air of surprised disapproval, as a colonel might look at a private whose bootlaces were undone. 'Ah yes,' he grunted. 'You'd better come inside.' The narrow, sunless hall smelled unpleasantly of stale cabbage; the walls were dirty with ink marks; it was all silent. His study, judging by the crumbs on the carpet, was also his dining-room. 'You'd better sit down,' he said, and proceeded to ask me a number of questions: what subjects I had taken in my General School Certificate; how old I was; what games I played; then fixing me suddenly with his bloodshot eyes, he asked me whether I thought games were a vital part of a boy's education. I mumbled something about not attaching too much importance to them. He grunted. I had said the wrong thing. The headmaster and I obviously had very little in common.

The school, he said, consisted of one class of twenty-four boys, ranging in age from seven to thirteen. I should have to teach all subjects except art, which he taught himself. Football and cricket were played in the Park, a mile away on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons. 

The teaching set-up filled me with fear. I should have to divide the class into three groups and teach them in turn at three different levels; and I was dismayed at the thought of teaching algebra and geometry-two subjects at which I had been completely incompetent at school. Worse perhaps was the idea of Saturday afternoon cricket; most of my friends would be enjoying leisure at that time.

I said shyly, 'What would my salary be?' 'Twelve pounds a week plus lunch.' Before I could protest, he got to his feet. 'Now', he said, 'you'd better meet my wife. She's the one who really runs this school.' 

This was the last straw. I was very young: the prospect of working under a woman constituted the ultimate indignity.



#### 49. Stonehenge (剑18 Test 2 Passage 1)

For centuries, historians and archaeologists have puzzled over the many mysteries of Stonehenge, a prehistoric monument that took an estimated 1,500 years to erect. Located on Salisbury Plain in southern England, it is comprised of roughly 100 massive upright stones placed in a circular layout. 

Archaeologists believe England’s most iconic prehistoric ruin was built in several stages, with the earliest constructed 5,000 or more years ago. First, Neolithic* Britons used primitive tools, which may have been fashioned out of deer antlers, to dig a massive circular ditch and bank, or henge. Deep pits dating back to that era and located within the circle may have once held a ring of timber posts, according to some scholars.

Several hundred years later, it is thought, Stonehenge’s builders hoisted an estimated 80 bluestones, 43 of which remain today, into standing positions and placed them in either a horseshoe or circular formation. These stones have been traced all the way to the Preseli Hills in Wales, some 300 kilometres from Stonehenge. How, then, did prehistoric builders without sophisticated tools or engineering haul these boulders, which weigh up to four tons, over such a great distance?

According to one long-standing theory among archaeologists, Stonehenge’s builders fashioned sledges and rollers out of tree trunks to lug the bluestones from the Preseli Hills. They then transferred the boulders onto rafts and floated them first along the Welsh coast and then up the River Avon toward Salisbury Plain; alternatively, they may have towed each stone with a fleet of vessels. More recent archaeological hypotheses have them transporting the bluestones with supersized wicker baskets on a combination of ball bearings and long grooved planks, hauled by oxen.

As early as the 1970s, geologists have been adding their voices to the debate over how Stonehenge came into being. Challenging the classic image of industrious builders pushing, carting, rolling or hauling giant stones from faraway Wales, some scientists have suggested that it was glaciers, not humans, that carried the bluestones to Salisbury Plain. Most archaeologists have remained sceptical about this theory, however, wondering how the forces of nature could possibly have delivered the exact number of stones needed to complete the circle.

The third phase of construction took place around 2000 BCE. At this point, sandstone slabs – known as ‘sarsens’ – were arranged into an outer crescent or ring; some were assembled into the iconic three-pieced structures called trilithons that stand tall in the centre of Stonehenge. Some 50 of these stones are now visible on the site, which may once have contained many more. Radiocarbon dating has revealed that work continued at Stonehenge until roughly 1600 BCE, with the bluestones in particular being
repositioned multiple times.

But who were the builders of Stonehenge? In the 17th century, archaeologist John Aubrey made the claim that Stonehenge was the work of druids, who had important religious, judicial and political roles in Celtic** society. This theory was widely popularized by the antiquarian William Stukeley, who had unearthed primitive graves at the site. Even today, people who identify as modern druids continue to gather at Stonehenge for the summer solstice. However, in the mid-20th century, radiocarbon dating demonstrated that Stonehenge stood more than 1,000 years before the Celts inhabited the region.

Many modern historians and archaeologists now agree that several distinct tribes of people contributed to Stonehenge, each undertaking a different phase of its construction. Bones, tools and other artefacts found on the site seem to support this hypothesis. The first stage was achieved by Neolithic agrarians who were likely to have been indigenous to the British Isles. Later, it is believed, groups with advanced tools and a more communal way of life left their mark on the site. Some believe that they were immigrants from the European continent, while others maintain that they were probably native Britons, descended from the original builders.

If the facts surrounding the architects and construction of Stonehenge remain shadowy at best, the purpose of the striking monument is even more of a mystery. While there is consensus among the majority of modern scholars that Stonehenge once served the function of burial ground, they have yet to determine what other purposes it had.

In the 1960s, the astronomer Gerald Hawkins suggested that the cluster of megalithic stones operated as a form of calendar, with different points corresponding to astrological phenomena such as solstices, equinoxes and eclipses occurring at different times of the year. While his theory has received a considerable amount of attention over the decades, critics maintain that Stonehenge’s builders probably lacked the knowledge necessary to predict such events or that England’s dense cloud cover would have obscured their view of the skies. 

More recently, signs of illness and injury in the human remains unearthed at Stonehenge led a group of British archaeologists to speculate that it was considered a place of healing, perhaps because bluestones were thought to have curative powers.

\* Neolithic – The era, also known as the New Stone Age, which began around 12,000 years ago and ended around 3500 BCE
** Celtic – The Celts were people who lived in Britain and northwest Europe during the Iron Age from 600 BCE to 43 CE





#### 50. An ideal city (剑18 Test 2 Passage 3)

*Leonardo da Vinci's ideal city was centuries ahead of its time*


The word 'genius' is universally associated with the name of Leonardo da Vinci. A true Renaissance man, he embodied scientific spirit, artistic talent and humanist sensibilities. Five hundred years have passed since Leonardo died in his home at Château du Clos Lucé, outside Tours, France. Yet far from fading into insignificance, his thinking has carried down the centuries and still surprises today.

The Renaissance marked the transition from the 15th century to modernity and took place after the spread of the plague in the 14th century, which caused a global crisis resulting in some 200 million deaths across Europe and Asia. Today, the world is on the cusp of a climate crisis, which is predicted to cause widespread displacement, extinctions and death, if left unaddressed. Then, as now, radical solutions were called for to revolutionise the way people lived and safeguard humanity against catastrophe.

Around 1486 – after a pestilence that killed half the population in Milan, Italy – Leonardo turned his thoughts to urban planning problems. Following a typical Renaissance trend, he began to work on an 'ideal city' project, which – due to its excessive costs – would remain unfulfilled. Yet given that unsustainable urban models are a key cause of global climate change today, it's only natural to wonder how Leonardo might have changed the shape of modern cities. Although the Renaissance is renowned as an era of incredible progress in art and architecture, it is rarely noted that the 15th century also marked the birth of urbanism as a true academic discipline. The rigour and method behind the conscious conception of a city had been largely missing in Western thought until the moment when prominent Renaissance men pushed forward large-scale urban projects in Italy, such as the reconfiguration of the town of Pienza and the expansion of the city of Ferrara. These works surely inspired Leonardo's decision to rethink the design of medieval cities, with their winding and overcrowded streets and with houses piled against one another.

It is not easy to identify a coordinated vision of Leonardo's ideal city because of his disordered way of working with notes and sketches. But from the largest collection of Leonardo's papers ever assembled, a series of innovative thoughts can be reconstructed regarding the foundation of a new city along the Ticino River, which runs from Switzerland into Italy and is 248 kilometres long. He designed the city for the easy transport of goods and clean urban spaces, and he wanted a comfortable and spacious city, with well-ordered streets and architecture. He recommended 'high, strong walls', with 'towers and battlements of all necessary and pleasant beauty'. 

His plans for a modern and 'rational' city were consistent with Renaissance ideals. But, in keeping with his personality, Leonardo included several innovations in his urban design. Leonardo wanted the city to be built on several levels, linked with vertical outdoor staircases. This design can be seen in some of today's high-rise buildings but was unconventional at the time. Indeed, this idea of taking full advantage of the interior spaces wasn't implemented until the 1920s and 1930s, with the birth of the Modernist movement.

While in the upper layers of the city, people could walk undisturbed between elegant palaces and streets, the lower layer was the place for services, trade, transport and industry. But the true originality of Leonardo's vision was its fusion of architecture and engineering. Leonardo designed extensive hydraulic plants to create artificial canals throughout the city. The canals, regulated by clocks and basins, were supposed to make it easier for boats to navigate inland. Leonardo also thought that the width of the streets ought to match the average height of the adjacent houses: a rule still followed in many contemporary cities across Italy, to allow access to sun and reduce the risk of damage from earthquakes.

Although some of these features existed in Roman cities, before Leonardo's drawings there had never been a multi-level, compact modern city which was thoroughly technically conceived. Indeed, it wasn't until the 19th century that some of his ideas were applied. For example, the subdivision of the city by function – with services and infrastructures located in the lower levels and wide and well-ventilated boulevards and walkways above for residents – is an idea that can be found in Georges-Eugène Haussmann's renovation of Paris under Emperor Napoleon III between 1853 and 1870.

Today, Leonardo's ideas are not simply valid, they actually suggest a way forward for urban planning. Many scholars think that the compact city, built upwards instead of outwards, integrated with nature (especially water systems), with efficient transport infrastructure, could help modern cities become more efficient and sustainable. This is yet another reason why Leonardo was aligned so closely with modern urban planning and centuries ahead of his time. 



#### 51. 剑19 Test 1 Part 1

SALLY: Good morning. Hinchingbrooke Country Park, Sally speaking. I'm one of the rangers.

JOHN: Oh hello. My name's John Chapman, and I'm a teaching assistant at a local primary school.

I've been asked to arrange a visit to the park for two of our classes.

SALLY: OK. What would you like to know?

JOHN: Well, I'm new to this area, so perhaps you could tell me something about the park first, please.

SALLY: Of course. Altogether the park covers 170 acres, that's 69 hectares.

There are three main types of habitat: wetland, grassland and woodland.

The woods are well established and varied, with an oak plantation, and other areas of mixed species.

JOHN: Right.

SALLY: The wetland is quite varied, too.

The original farmland was dug up around 40 years ago to extract gravel.

Once this work was completed, the gravel pits filled with water, forming the two large lakes.

There are also several smaller ones, ponds and a stream that flows through the park.

JOHN: OK, so I suppose with these different habitats there's quite a variety of wildlife.

SALLY: There certainly is – a lot of different species of birds and insects, and also animals like deer and rabbits.

JOHN: And I understand you organise educational visits for school parties.

SALLY: That's right. We can organise a wide range of activities and adapt them to suit all ages.

JOHN: Can you give me some examples of the activities?

SALLY: Well, one focus is on science, where we help children to discover and study plants, trees and insects.

They also collect and analyse data about the things they see.

JOHN: Uhuh.

SALLY: Another focus is on geography.

The park is a great environment to learn and practise reading a map and using a compass to navigate around the park.

JOHN: Do you do anything connected with history?

SALLY: Yes, we do. For instance, the children can explore how the use of the land has changed over time. Then there's leisure and tourism.

JOHN: That focuses on your visitors, I would imagine.

SALLY: Yes, mostly. The children find out about them, their requirements, the problems they may cause and how we manage these.

And another subject we cover is music: here the children experiment with natural materials to create sounds and explore rhythm and tempo.

JOHN: That must be fun!

SALLY: Most children really enjoy it.

SALLY: And of course, all the activities are educational, too.

Learning outside the classroom encourages children to be creative, and to explore and discover for themselves.

JOHN: I would imagine they get a sense of freedom that might not be a normal part of their lives.

SALLY: That's right. And very often the children discover that they can do things they didn't know they could do, and they develop new skills.

This gives them greater self-confidence.

JOHN: It sounds great. So, what about the practical side of it?

How much does it cost for a full-day visit? We would expect to bring between 30 and 40 children.

SALLY: If there are over 30, it costs £4.95 for each child who attends on the day.

We invoice you afterwards, so you don't pay for children who can't come because of sickness, for example.

There's no charge for leaders and other adults – as many as you want to bring.

JOHN: That sounds very fair. Well, thanks for all the information.

I'll need to discuss it with my colleagues, and I hope to get back to you soon to make a booking.

SALLY: We'll look forward to hearing from you. Goodbye.

JOHN: Goodbye, and thank you.



#### 52. 剑19 Test 1 Part 2

It's great to see so many members of the Twinning Association here tonight.

Since the twinning link between our two towns, Stanthorpe here in England and Malatte in France, was established, the relationship between the towns has gone from strength to strength.

Last month, 25 members of the association from Stanthorpe spent a weekend in Malatte.

Our hosts had arranged a great programme.

We learned how cheese is produced in the region and had the chance to taste the products.

The theme park trip had to be cancelled, but we all had a great time on the final boat trip down the river – that was the real highlight.

This is a special year for the Association because it's 25 years since we were founded.

In Malatte, they're planning to mark this by building a footbridge in the municipal park.

We've been discussing what to do here and we've decided to plant a poplar tree in the museum gardens.

We considered buying a garden seat to put there, but the authorities weren't happy with that idea.

In terms of fundraising to support our activities, we've done very well. Our pancake evening was well attended and made record profits.

And everyone enjoyed the demonstration of French cookery, which was nearly as successful.

Numbers for our film show were limited because of the venue so we're looking for somewhere bigger next year.

We're looking forward to welcoming our French visitors here next week, and I know that many of you here will be hosting individuals or families.

The coach from France will arrive at 5 pm on Friday. Don't try to do too much that first evening as they'll be tired, so have dinner in the house or garden rather than eating out.

The weather looks as if it'll be OK so you might like to plan a barbecue.

Then the next morning's market day in town, and that's always a good place to stroll round.

On Saturday evening, we'll all meet up at the football club, where once again we'll have Toby Sharp and his band performing English and Scottish country songs.

Toby will already be well known to many of you as last year he organised our special quiz night and presented the prizes.

Now on Sunday, we'll be taking our visitors to Farley House. You may not all be familiar with it, so here's a map to help you.

You can see the car park at the bottom of the map.

There's an excellent farm shop in the grounds where our visitors can buy local produce – it's in the old stables, which is the first building you come to.

They're built round a courtyard, and the shop's in the far corner on the left. There's also a small café on the right as you go in.

I know that one or two of our visitors may not be all that mobile.

The main entrance to the house has a lot of steps so you might want to use the disabled entry. This is on the far side of the house from the car park.

Children will probably be most interested in the adventure playground.

That's at the northern end of the larger lake, in a bend on the path that leads to the lake. There's lots for children to do there.

There are a number of lovely gardens near the house.

The kitchen gardens are rectangular and surrounded by a wall.

They're to the north-east of the house, quite near the smaller lake. They're still in use and have a great collection of fruit and vegetables.

The Temple of the Four Winds is a bit more of a walk – but it's worth it.

Take the path from the car park and go past the western sides of the stables and the house.

Then when the path forks, take the right-hand path. Go up there with the woods on your left and the temple is right at the end.

There are great views over the whole area.

OK, so that's…



#### 53. 剑19 Test 1 Part 3

COLIN: I haven't seen you for a bit, Marie.

MARIE: No. I've been busy with my project.

COLIN: You're making a vegan alternative to eggs, aren't you? Something that doesn't use animal products?

MARIE: Yes. I'm using chickpeas. I had two main aims when I first started looking for an alternative to eggs, but actually I've found chickpeas have got more advantages.

COLIN: Right.

MARIE: But how about your project on reusing waste food – you were looking at bread, weren't you?

COLIN: Yes. It's been hard work, but I've enjoyed it.

The basic process was quite straightforward – breaking the stale bread down to a paste then reforming it.

MARIE: But you were using 3-D printing, weren't you, to make the paste into biscuits?

COLIN: Yeah, I'd used that before, but in this project, I had time to play around with different patterns for the biscuits and finding how I could add fruit and vegetables to make them a more appetising colour, and I was really pleased with what I managed to produce.

MARIE: It must've been a great feeling to make something appetising out of bits of old bread that would've been thrown away otherwise.

COLIN: It was. And I'm hoping that some of the restaurants in town will be interested in the biscuits. I'm going to send them some samples.

MARIE: I came across something on the internet yesterday that might interest you. It was a company that's developed touch-sensitive sensors for food labels.

COLIN: Mmm?

MARIE: It's a special sort of label on the food package. When the label's smooth, the food is fresh and then when you can feel bumps on the label that means the food's gone bad.

It started off as a project to help visually impaired people know whether food was fit to eat or not.

COLIN: Interesting. So just solid food?

MARIE: No, things like milk and juice as well. But actually, I thought it might be really good for drug storage in hospitals and pharmacies.

COLIN: Right. And coming back to food, maybe it'd be possible to use it for other things besides freshness. Like how many kilograms a joint of meat is, for example.

MARIE: Yes, there's all sorts of possibilities.

COLIN: I was reading an article about food trends predicting how eating habits might change in the next few years.

MARIE: Oh – things like more focus on local products? That seems so obvious, but the shops are still full of imported foods.

COLIN: Yes, they need to be more proactive to address that.

MARIE: And somehow motivate consumers to change, yes.

COLIN: One thing everyone's aware of is the need for a reduction in unnecessary packaging – but just about everything you buy in supermarkets is still covered in plastic. The government needs to do something about it.

MARIE: Absolutely. It's got to change.

COLIN: Do you think there'll be more interest in gluten- and lactose-free food?

MARIE: For people with allergies or food intolerances? I don't know.

Lots of people I know have been buying that type of food for years now.

COLIN: Yes, even if they haven't been diagnosed with an allergy.

MARIE: That's right. One thing I've noticed is the number of branded products related to celebrity chefs – people watch them cooking on TV and then buy things like spice mixes or frozen foods with the chef's name on . . . I bought something like that once, but I won't again.

COLIN: Yeah – I bought a ready-made spice mix for chicken which was supposed to be used by a chef I'd seen on television, and it didn't actually taste of anything.

MARIE: Mm. Did the article mention ‘ghost kitchens' used to produce takeaway food?

COLIN: No. What are they?

MARIE: Well, they might have the name of a restaurant, but actually they're a cooking facility just for delivery meals – the public don't ever go there.

But people aren't aware of that – it's all kept very quiet.

COLIN: So people don't realise the food's not actually from the restaurant?

MARIE: Right.

COLIN: Did you know more and more people are using all sorts of different mushrooms now, to treat different health concerns? Things like heart problems?

MARIE: Hmm. They might be taking a big risk there.

COLIN: Yes, it's hard to know which varieties are safe to eat.

Anyway maybe now . . .

**Describe a person you really enjoy studying/working with.**
You should say:
Who the person is
When you often study/work together
What you study/work together
And explain why you enjoy studying/working with him/her 



The person I thoroughly enjoy working with is my colleague, Emily. She's about the same age as me and works as a graphic designer in our marketing team. We've been working together for approximately two years now, often collaborating on various advertising projects for our company.
Emily and I typically work together on creating visual content that ranges from social media graphics to larger advertising campaigns. Our collaboration is most intense during the brainstorming and execution phases of these projects, which usually happen a few times a month depending on the workload and campaign schedules.
What makes working with Emily so enjoyable is her vibrant creativity and exceptional sense of humor. She has an uncanny ability to come up with fresh and innovative ideas that not only meet but often exceed our project goals. For instance, for a recent campaign aimed at young adults, Emily suggested we use augmented reality in our ads, which turned out to be a huge hit and significantly boosted our engagement rates.
Moreover, her positivity and light-hearted approach make even the most stressful deadlines manageable and fun. She has a way of turning challenges into exciting puzzles to solve, which significantly enhances our team dynamics and overall productivity. Her energy is contagious, and it motivates everyone in the team to push their limits creatively.
Additionally, Emily is a great communicator, always clear about her ideas and receptive to feedback, making the iterative process of our projects seamless and effective. This level of synergy not only makes our workdays enjoyable but also tremendously productive, which is why I always look forward to projects where we can team up.

You should say:
Who he/she is
When he/she made the decision
What decision he/she made
And explain how you felt about the decision 



One of my closest friends, Sarah, made an excellent decision recently that truly impressed me. Sarah, who has always been incredibly passionate about environmental conservation, decided to turn her passion into her profession. This decision came about three months ago, in the midst of what seemed like an endless cycle of unsatisfying jobs.
Sarah chose to quit her high-paying, yet unfulfilling corporate job to join a non-profit organization that focuses on marine conservation. The decision was a significant one because it not only meant a drastic career shift but also came with a considerable pay cut. However, she was determined to contribute more directly to a cause she cares deeply about.
This was a good decision for several reasons. Firstly, it aligned perfectly with her values and passion, which is crucial for long-term job satisfaction and personal happiness. Secondly, her background in business management is proving invaluable to the organization, which often struggles with strategic planning and fund management. Sarah's skillset has already started to positively impact their operations.
From my perspective, Sarah's decision was both brave and inspirational. It's not every day you see someone align their career so closely with their personal convictions, especially when it involves financial risk. Watching her take this step made me reevaluate my own career choices and the impact I want to have in the world. It was a powerful reminder that sometimes, the right decision might not be the easiest one, but it can be the most rewarding. Her courage and clarity have certainly left a lasting impression on me, and I felt incredibly proud of her choice.

I remember attending a conference where James was a keynote speaker. His presentation was not only informative but also incredibly engaging, leaving the audience both impressed and inspired. His ability to convey complex ideas in a simple and captivating manner is a testament to his talent.
I realized the extent of James's talent when he received multiple awards for his work, including the prestigious Canadian Marketing Association Award. His achievements are a reflection of his dedication, creativity, and relentless pursuit of excellence.
In conclusion, James is a multi-talented individual whose creativity, strategic thinking, and communication skills set him apart. His contributions to our projects and his recognition in the industry are clear indicators of his exceptional talent. Working with him has been both a privilege and an inspiration.



#### 58. 丁丁在美国   Tintin in America

Chicago, the windy city, sometimes called America's gateway to the west, has recently fallen under control of gangsters...

... no... too much.

The Mob rules Chicago.

Nah!

You know, Snowy, if this story is supposed to be true, then we're gonna have to prove it.

Extra! Extra! Read all about it! Tintin's coming to Chicago!

World-famous reporter doing expose on organized crime!

I don't like this.

I hear this Tintin can be a real trouble-maker.

If he does this "expose", it could be bad for business.

Catch my drift?

Don't worry, boss, I'll take care of things.

Tintin won't be any trouble, I guarantee it.

Well, here we are, Snowy! Chicago!

Looking for a taxi, sir?

Yeah, sure.

I'm going to the Osborne Hotel.

Sure thing!

Hey, driver.

What's going on?

Hey!

Too bad you won't get to appreciate the view!

I don't like this, Snowy. Let's get out of here!

C'mon, Snowy! This is our chance.

Hey, police! Over here!

There he is!

Faster!

We're gaining on him!

Police! Pull over!

The taxi's run into trouble.

Send the Australian and arrange for a special car!

But they offered me 500 bucks!

Who?

I can't tell you! They'll kill me!

No one's going to kill you. You'll get police protection.

Police protection? You don't understand...

The police are...

Oh, no!

Hey you, stop!

Stop! Stop! Hey!

Faster!

We nearly got him!

Thank you!

Hello?

Hello? Is anyone there?

Hello.

Who is this?

Hands up! Drop the gun!

Now don't make a move!

Operator!

Right away, Mr Tintin.

Ohhh! Mr. Smiles!

Remember: I wasn't here.

Yes, sir!

Come in.

Mr. Tintin? I'm Detective Andrews.

That was quick.

The hotel operator said you needed help.

Yes, this gangster broke into my room with a gun.

I see. OK, we'll take him downtown.

Would you mind coming with us to sign a complaint?

It would be my pleasure, detectives.

I know it's a little out of the way, but this is police's secret headquarters for mob activity.

It's easier than working out of the station.

I see.

They sure don't look like policemen to me, Snowy.

Right, in there.

Sit down, Mr Tintin. It's a pleasure to meet you.

Thanks! But who are you?

My name is Bobby Smiles.

I'm the underboss of the Chicago Mob Syndicate.

Mob Syndicate! I knew there was something wrong with this set-up.

You're nothing but a gangster!

I prefer the title "syndicate member" myself.

Why was I brought here?

Because I wanted to meet you personally before you leave town!

I'll make it worth your while, Mr. Tintin.

Say $200,000?

Of course, if you decide not to accept my offer, then I'll be forced to make you leave in a less pleasant way.

I don't like bribes or threats, Mr Smiles.

I'll leave Chicago when I'm ready after I've finished my story.

I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Tintin.

You see, you don't have much choice.

Gas!

Snowy!

Stay close to the floor.

I hope the fish are hungry!

What was that?

I didn't hear anythin'!

I don't see anything down there!

That's 'cause you're looking in the wrong place.

Drop your guns!

Thank you.

Hey guys! Know how you call the police without a phone?

Well?

I thought you were taking care of this guy, Smiles.

I am, boss, trust me. Everything's under controI.

It better be, or you're next, see?

That's Tintin's hoteL room on the 37th floor.

Just make sure you don't miss.

I never miss, Mr Smiles.

Kid's stuff!

I knew those gangsters would try again!

Good thing we took precautions, eh, Snowy.

And now that they think we're dead, we can set our own trap!

Mr. Smiles, we just got a tip.

A disguised truck full of treasury bills is leaving for New York, and get this, without a police escort.

No police escort?

Yeah, they didn't want to call attention to the truck in case someone got ideas about hijackin' it.

Now what kind of a person would do a thing like that?

Get the men together, Bugsy!

Do you think they'll fall for this, Tintin?

I'm pretty sure they will, Chief. Look!

Well, well, what have we got here?

Hands up!

Hands up! You're under arrest!

Tintin, thanks to you, we've landed a very big fish!

So, where is Smiles?

One of our informant spotted Smiles here this morning.

Apparently, he's got a cabin in the mountains.

Don't worry, Chief, I'll find him.

You just get the jail cell ready.

We sort of stick out like a sore thumb, don't we, Snowy?

So? What do you think?

Next on the list: transportation!

Sure, I have a horse, you can use for a few days.

I got just the one for you. Her name's Beatrice.

Hello, Beatrice.

I don't think Beatrice likes me very much.

Have you got any other horses?

You'll be happy with this one.

I'm sure I will. Ready, Snowy?

Giddyup!

Whoa, boy!

According to this map, Smiles' cabin is up there.

Tintin!

I don't know how he found me, but he's gonna wish he never did.

Looks like we're continuing on foot.

That's right.

Just a few more feet.

There it is.

C'mon, Snowy!

A little closer.

No!

That was close!

Tintin won't be bothering me again!

Oh, no?

Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Smiles. Let's go! The police are waiting.

Ever since Tintin came to town, business has ground to a halt.

Because of him, half of us are in jail, the other half are posting bail.

It's time someone took care of that guy.

Someone like me!

Okay, Snowy, let's go.

We've got to meet the Chief of Police in 20 minutes.

Snowy?

Now where has he gone?

Snowy?

If you want to see your dog again, wave a white handkerchief from the window.

Those scoundrels! They kidnapped Snowy!

It's probably a trap. I've gotta be very careful.

Extra! Extra! Read all about it!

Paper, mister? — Sure, kid.

Any minute now.

Mr. Tintin may be a good reporter, but he sure has some strange requests!

Now for our next order of business: Tintin, the nosy reporter!

Looks like I'm on to something big!

Well, Bugsy left a message at Tintin's hotel to be on the pier at 9 with the cash.

Ten of our men will be waiting for him.

He won't walk away this time.

Pssst! Hey, kid!

You want to earn 10 bucks?

Yes, gentlemen. We'll soon be rid of that pest for good!

Hey!

Give me my ball back!

I'll give you your ball back! Come here, you little brat!

It's 9 O'clock. I'd better call the men to see if Tintin showed up.

Bugsy? Bugsy? !

Hey! What's going on?

Well, that takes care of them!

Snowy!

Snowy! Hold on! I'll have you out in a minute!

Good boy!

C'mon, let's get outta here!

There he is!

Hurry! Get him!

Hurry up!

Game over, Bugsy!

Now the real fun begins!

Chief, this is Tintin.

I'm at 2117 Lakeside Avenue.

You'd better come right away with reinforcements.

I've got a little surprise for you!

Well, gentlemen, it's 9:30.

By now Tintin is dead, and our problems are over.

Freeze!

Police! You're under arrest!

... and the crowd is going wild!

Tintin is a hero here!

Chicago can hold its head high again.

The mob has been put out of action.

They had been ruthless enemies, cruel and desperate men.

That's that!

Hello?

What?

Oh, no! I'll be right over.

Come on, Snowy. Here we go again!





#### 59. 02法老的雪茄 1  Cigars of the Pharaoh -1

Some vacation, huh, Snowy?

A stopover in Egypt tomorrow, then next stop, Bombay, then on to Hong Kong.

Ahhh, this is great.

I say! Save that paper!

Help, somebody! Save that paper!

I'll get it!

That's it!

Excuse me! Coming through!

Uh-oh! Snowy!

Good try, my boy.

Sorry, we couldn't save your paper, sir.

Oh, that's alright.

It was just a travel brochure.

What?

Now, if it had been my priceless papyrus, that would be another matter.

Allow me to introduce myself.

I am Dr. Sarcophagus.

Hi, I'm Tintin, reporter.

Well, Tintin the reporter, the winds of fate have just blown the story of a lifetime your way.

Oh?

I, Sophocles Sarcophagus, the greatest archaeologist of all time, am about to unearth the lost tomb of the pharaoh Kih-Oskh.

No kidding?

No kidding?

My dear boy, I never kid.

Especially when discussing the lost tomb of the pharaoh.

Lesser archaeologists have dared its curse, but none never returned.

None?

It could make quite a story for you.

Okay! Count me in!

Bravo! We meet in Cairo at 10 tomorrow.

Then, on to the tomb.

Is this the symbol for the Pharaoh's tomb?

We'll find out tomorrow.

And until then, good day.

Ohh!

You nearsighted klutz!

Watch where you're going!

It was just an accident, sir.

Why, you nosy little punk!

This is a day you'll regret.

Nobody talks to R. J. Rastapopoulos that way! Nobody!

Now where have I seen him before?

Ah, yes. R. J. Rastapopoulos, the famous movie producer.

Beware, Dr. Sarcophagus met the young troublemaker.

Dispose of him before we reach Cairo.

Just think, Thompson, we've flown all this way to arrest our prey.

There are no friends in our line of work, Thomson.

So true, Thompson, so true.

Come in.

Don't make a move!

Thompson and Thomson! What are you guys doing here?

Don't play innocent with us!

What is this? A joke?

Does this look like a joke to you?

Opium?

He admits it!

I don't admit anything!

Exercising your right to remain silent, are you?

Very well.

We're detaining you until the ship docks at port.

Come along.

But what about my plans?

This is supposed to be my vacation!

Some vacation.

The story of a lifetime comes along and here I am, framed as a drug smuggler.

Hm, I wonder...

Hi! Heading ashore by any chance?

Tintin gave the slip to the Police, and will probably meet Sarcophagus in Cairo.

You have your orders.

Don't fail me.

Aren't you worried about the Pharaoh's curse, Doctor?

My dear boy.

I am not one of those amateur archaeologists fumbling about in the desert.

Doctor! Look!

I found it!

Fame at last!

The name of Sophocles Sarcophagus will live in the arcanes of archeology forever!

What is it, Snowy?

A cigar?

Isn't that the Pharaoh's emblem?

Doctor! Look at this!

Doctor?

Doctor!

The Pharaoh's emblem!

Doctor.

Doctor!

Aha! A secret entrance.

He must have gone inside.

Doctor Sarcophagus?

Doctor!

Sealed.

Believe in curses, Snowy?

Me neither. Let's go!

That's his umbrella.

And his coat.

Doctor!

More cigars.

The Pharaoh's curse!

These must be the missing archaeologists.

Dr. Sarcophagus!

Oh, no! No way!

Let's get out of here, Snowy.

No!

What's that?

Gas!

Snowy! Snowy!

No!

Leave me alone!

Move it! Move it!

Coast Guard!

Prepare for boarding!

A raid! Dump the coffins! Fast!

All hands on deck!

Snowy, you're safe!

Dr. Sarcophagus!

It's a fine moooorning!

What? Shout louder. I can't hear you over the wind.

What's that? I can't hear a word.

It's the wind!

It's hopeless. He's getting further and further away.

Good thing we dumped the evidence or they would've nabbed us.

Now if we could only find it again.

Message from the boss.

Shipment contains prisoners to be taken to rendezvous three. Guard strictly pending further orders.

What?

Captain! Look!

Get him aboard!

It's getting really rough, Snowy.

Nooo!

My head.

Ah! There you are, my dear sir!

Huh?

Can I interest you in some of the finest merchandise you ever laid eyes on?

But... but I... I don't...

Fear not, sir.

I'm sure my prices will astonish you.

Prices?

Just let me show you, sir.

Absolutely no obligation.

Beautiful. Beautiful!

Look how it matches your eyes.

Quite, quite perfect.

Yech. What about a sword?

Real Toledo steel.

An alarm clock? Toothbrush?

Everything a bargain.

What's going on, Snowy?

Right, lads.

Break it up, back to work.

Perhaps some other time, dear sir.

My passenger, Mr. Digala, from Lisbon.

So, how are you feeling today, young Sinbad?

I've felt better, Captain.

You're lucky to be alive.

If my men hadn't spotted you...

Dr. Sarcophagus!

Who?

Did you pick up anyone else last night, Captain?

Just you and the dog.

I must get ashore fast.

My friend is in serious danger.

Goodbye! Good luck!

Goodbye, Captain! And thank you!

You sure I couldn't interest you in something else, young man?

Another canteen, perhaps?

No, thanks. I'm sure I'll be fine.

Goodbye.

Goodbye!

We must find a town, Snowy.

Wow! I didn't expect one so soon!

The place is deserted.

Uh-oh, there's somebody here and they're in trouble!

It's okay, miss, you're safe now.

Cut, cut, cut!

Idiot! Imbecile!

You wrecked the whole scene!

Nitwit!

I'm sorry. I didn't know.

What is this? A coffee break?

Why aren't you shooting?

It's all his fault, sir.

Mr. Rastapopoulos?

You!

I'm really very sorry.

That's all right.

No harm done.

So, what are you doing in the middle of the desert?

It's a long story, sir.

Good. My favorite kind.

Well, what are you waiting for?

Get back to work!

Now you'll have to tell me all about it.

I'd be careful if I were you.

It sounds like there might be something to this curse.

Perhaps.

Well, good luck, young man.

And take care in the desert.

Thanks, sir. Goodbye!

Tintin is heading towards Cairo.

See that he doesn't make it.

You're sure that anonymous tip said Tintin was disguised as an Arab?

Positive. That's him alright.

Come peacefully...

or we'll resort to violence!

Run, Thompson, run!

To be precise, I'm running!

Feels like we've been walking forever, Snowy.

Want some, Snowy?

We have to go easy on it.

Get down!

Someone still wants us out of the way, Snowy, and I don't really want to find out who.

Let's go.

Oh, no! Our water!

Gotta keep moving.

Water.

You!

Why are you not in uniform?

The raiders are set to attack!

Attack?

Have you not heard? War has been declared.

Consider yourself drafted. Move it!

Another fine mess I've gotten myself into.

Huh?

The cigars!

Where there's smoke, there's...

bingo!

Hollow?

Send 200 cases of cigars to Gaipajama, India, in view of next 'opium harvest.' Guards! Seize this spy!

Some vacation!

I know I wanted to get away from it all, but a firing squad at dawn?

Ouch.

Pst. Pst.

Over here.

A file!

Wait! Who are you?

Shhh. Hurry.

Come on, Snowy.

It's safe to talk now.

I want to thank you!

Thought you'd given us the slip, did you?

Shameless drug smuggler!

Thompson and Thomson!

Look, I'm not the smuggler. The colonel is.

At least he's involved.

I was framed, Detectives.

They kidnapped me and Dr. Sarcophagus!

Kidnapped? Why?

We found a shipment of hollow cigars that they use to smuggle drugs.

There's a shipment on its way to India right now.

Oh, that's not good.

To be precise, that's...

There he goes! Get him!

He's on the roof! Quickly!

Now is our chance, Snowy!

You again! Where is your uniforms?

Sorry, sir, but...

I quit!

Now, let's get out of here!

Excuse me!

There he is!

Ready?

Aim!

Fire!

Hey, hey, hey!

A plane!

But how do I get past the guard?

Help! Help! Help!

Mad dog! Mad dog!

Help!

Stop that plane!

I hope Thompson and Thomson made it.

We'll need all the help we can get if we're going to save Dr. Sarcophagus from those smugglers.

Are you ready for it, Snowy?

Look out, India, here we come!





#### 60. 03法老的雪茄 2  Cigars of the Pharaoh -2

It all started while Snowy and I were enjoying a well-deserved vacation cruise.

Ah. This is great!

The winds of fate have just blown the story of a lifetime your way.

Okay! Count me in!

An eccentric archaeologist, Dr. Sarcophagus invited me to search for the lost tomb of the Pharaoh Kih-Oskh.

Fame at last!

What is it, Snowy?

A cigar?

The Pharaoh's emblem and the start of all our troubles.

Doctor?

A secret entrance!

There was no choice but to enter the tomb and hopefully find Dr. Sarcophagus.

But the further Snowy and I went, the further the mystery deepened.

More cigars!

No!

Gas!

Snowy! Snowy!

We had stumbled into a terrible trap and were almost disposed of in almost unusual way.

Move it!

Coast Guard!

Dump the coffins! Fast!

You're lucky to be alive.

Did you pick up anyone else last night, Captain?

Just you and the dog.

I must get ashore fast. My friend is in serious danger.

Tintin is heading towards Cairo.

See that he doesn't make it.

Get down!

Someone still wants us out of the way, Snowy.

And I don't really wanna find out who.

Our adventures kept taking us back to the same mystery.

The cigars!

Send 200 cases of cigars to Gaipajama, India, in view of next opium harvest!

Guards!

We uncovered an international smuggling operation that could only be stopped where it started.

Look out, India! Here we come!

There it is, Snowy.

The coast of India!

Oh, no! It's broken!

We're out of gas!

Okay! Okay! I'm coming!

Let's find the road to Gaipajama, Snowy.

The Pharaoh's emblem!

It's wet.

Whoever did this is still around.

Dr. Sarcophagus?

I'm afraid you make a mistake, young man.

My name isn't Sarcophacus.

I'm Pharaoh Ramses II!

Ruler of all the Nile!

He's completely mad!

Now, what have you done with your pants?

That hurt.

Poison.

Oh! That's pretty!

Here! Ki-ki-ki-ki!

We'd better get him to a doctor before he hurts himself.

Why, hello there.

Sorry to bother you...

Tutankhamun!

Oh!

Oh, no. Sorry to bother you, sir.

But my friend has been hit with a poisoned dart.

I need to get him to a hospital.

Ah, yes. I see.

Well, actually, you're in luck.

One of my guests is a man of medicine.

Oh, uh, Dr. Finney!

Yes?

It seems we've got a spot of bother, doctor.

I think he's been poisoned, sir.

Bring him upstairs. I'll examine him there.

Uh, Ramses II?

Ra would like a word with you.

Oh, goodie!

Mr. and Mrs. Snowball, allow me to introduce...

Tintin. Pleased to meet you.

Charmed.

Make yourself comfortable, Tintin.

The doctor will be down shortly.

So tell us, Major. What's the story behind this dagger?

Ah, my Hindu Kukri.

It was a present from a local fakir.

He says it has magical properties.

How fascinating!

Yes, quite.

The fakir claims it will point to anyone whose life is in danger.

Dr. Finney, is my friend going to be all right?

What did you find?

The dart was dipped with Rajaijah juice.

The poison of madness.

There's an asylum a few miles up the road.

You must take him there immediately.

I've written a letter to the director with all the details.

Thank you, sir.

Dr. Sarcophagus is gone!

My wife!

Darling, speak to me.

Someone came in through the window!

There was a lunatic threatening me with a knife.

My Kukri dagger! It's gone!

I'm very sorry about this, everyone.

Come on, Snowy. Let's go.

Can you follow his trail in the rain, Snowy?

Must kill reporter.

The Professor's hat!

He's around here somewhere.

Oh, phooey!

Huh?

Must kill reporter.

Must kill reporter.

My dagger.

I want my dagger!

Sorry, Ramses.

But Pharaoh's shouldn't try to kill their friends.

The eyes made me do it.

What eyes?

Th... Th... Those eyes!

Fear not, young man.

Who are you?

I am the power.

What... Do... You...

Just watch my eyes.

My eyes.

Oh?

My eyes.

Oh!

Thanks, Snowy.

He's gone!

So, Dr. Finney wanted you to hand this letter to me.

He told me you'd take care of everything.

I see. Let me show you where we will be keeping your friend.

Do you think we'll be able to cure him?

Anything is possible.

A padded cell?

Is he really that bad?

Not him. You!

Hey!

You should commit the one who hands over this letter.

He will claim it is his friend who is insane, don't believe him.

You're making a mistake!

Don't worry, your friend will be looked after.

Why, thank you.

Goodbye.

Happy birthday!

No!

Breakfast.

Eat your cereal and you'll get a cupcake for lunch.

I don't like cupcakes.

Come back here.

Inmate escaping!

Stop him!

Stop him!

Stop him!

Look out! There's an inmate escaping!

Stop him!

Not me, you fool!

Jump, Snowy! I'll catch you.

...

Well, well.

We meet again.

Thought you'd given us the slip, did you?

Oh!

I've got him!

Me too.

Goodness.

Gracious.

Who... Who are you?

You tell of a complicated route to Gaipajama, my friend, but now that you are here, what next?

Snowy.

Ah, yes. I've instructed my guards to make inquiries, we should hear something soon.

I hope so.

Don't worry, they'll find him.

It's time for your afternoon studies, my son.

What is it?

That music. Last time I heard it my father went mad.

Before that, it was my brother.

Hm. Does your family fight the opium trade, Maharajah?

Yes. How did you know?

Smugglers took over my people's poppy farms.

My family tried to force them out.

But then, they went mad.

Don't make a move!

You're under arrest, in the name of the law, to be precise.

Careful.

He's gone!

Aha! A secret doorway!

You're late.

Take your seat, brother.

Our meeting is now in session.

First, I extend greetings from the boss.

Next, I'm happy to inform you that the Maharajah is no longer a concern.

Headquarters.

What? Our hideout in Cairo has been raided.

Only our boss escaped.

Yes. Yes. I see.

Brothers, we have a spy in our midst.

Now since the rules prevent us from revealing our identities, you'll come to me one by one into the next room and tell me the password from last week's meeting.

First one!

Last one!

Finished.

Good thing I was called first.

Wow, this is quite the party.

The fakir, Colonel Fahd, Mr. and Mrs. Snowball, Dr. Finney.

Well, that certainly explains the letter.

The Maharajah's secretary, and last, but I'll bet not least, Allan!

The fakir!

Freeze!

Right! Nobody move.

Snowy!

My friend, I must thank you.

If not for that dummy you've placed in my bed, I would be completely mad by now.

Glad to be of service!

Your Highness! Your Highness!

Your son has been kidnapped!

Two men. They made off with him in an automobile!

Come on, Snowy!

There they are!

Master, we're being followed!

Oh, no!

No! They crashed!

Or didn't they?

Look out!

Missed! Get rid of him.

I only got left the kid.

You!

No!

No, snowy, don't look at him.

I surrender.

What?

I surrender.

Well, fine.

Surrender.

I, I, uh...

Surrender.

No. No.

You are in my pow...

He's got the Maharajah's son.

Stop!

Diablo/i! Can I ever be rid of that nosy reporter?

Yes. Just a little closer.

This time I can't miss!

No!

Ah. There you are.

Don't worry.

I'll have you back to your father in no time.

This morning, another shipment of opium was found.

The drug ring is indeed smashed.

Great! Everything's back to normal, then.

Behold!

Behold your Pharaoh, Ramses II!

Behold!

Well, almost everything.





#### 61. 夜莺与玫瑰 The Nightingale and the Rose

"She said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses," cried the Student, "but in all my garden there is no red rose."

From her nest in the oak tree the Nightingale heard him, and she looked out through the leaves and wondered.

"No red rose in all my garden!" he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled with tears.

"Ah, on what little things does happiness depend!

I have read all that the wise men have written, and all the secrets of philosophy are mine, yet for want of a red rose my life is made wretched."

"Here at last is a true lover," said the Nightingale.

"Night after night have I sung of him, though I knew him not, night after night have I told his story to the stars and now I see him.

His hair is dark as the hyacinth-blossom, and his lips are red as the rose of his desire; but passion has made his face like pale ivory, and sorrow has set her seal upon his brow."

"The Prince gives a ball tomorrow night," murmured the young student, "and my love will be of the company.

If I bring her a red rose she will dance with me till dawn.

If I bring her a red rose, I should hold her in my arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will be clasped in mine.

But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall sit lonely, and she will pass me by.

She will have no notice of me, my heart will break."

"Here, indeed, is the true lover," said the Nightingale.

"What I sing of he suffers; what is joy to me to his pain.

Surely love is a wonderful thing.

It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals.

Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the market-place.

It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold."

"The musicians will sit in their gallery," said the young Student, and my love will dance to the sound of the harp and the violin.

She will dance so lightly that her feet will not touch the floor.

But with me she will not dance, I have no red rose to give her."

And he flung himself down on the grass, and buried his face in his hands, and wept.

"Why is he weeping"? asked a little Green Lizard, as he ran past him with his tail in the air.

"Why, indeed"? said a Butterfly, fluttering about after a sunbeam.

"Why, indeed"? whispered a Daisy to his neighbour, in a soft voice.

"He is weeping for a red rose," said the Nightingale.

"For a red rose"? they cried: "how very ridiculous!"

and the little Lizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright.

But the Nightingale understood the secret of the Student's sorrow, and she sat silent in the oak-tree, and thought about the mystery of Love.

Suddenly she spread her brown wings, and soared into the air.

She passed through the grove like a shadow and like a shadow she sailed across the garden.

In the center of the grass-plot was standing a beautiful Rose-tree, when she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray.

"Give me a red rose," she cried, "and I will sing you my sweetest song."

"My roses are white," it answered; "as white as the foam of the sea, and whiter than the snow upon the mountain.

But go to my brother who grows round the old sun-dial, and perhaps he will give you what you want."

So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing round the old sun-dial.

"Give me a red rose," she cried, "and I will sing you my sweetest song."

"My roses are yellow," it answered; "as yellow as the hair of the mermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the daffodil that blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe.

Go to my brother who grows beneath the Student's window, and perhaps he will give you what you want."

So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing beneath the Student's window.

"Give me a red rose," she cried, "and I will sing you my sweetest song."

"My roses are red," it answered, "as red as the feet of the dove, and redder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the ocean-cavern.

But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no roses at all this year."

"One red rose is all I want," cried the Nightingale,

"only one red rose!

Is there no way I can get it?"

"There is a way," answered the Tree; "but it is so terrible that I dare not tell you."

"Tell it to me," said the Nightingale, "I am not afraid."

"If you want a red rose," said the Tree, "you must build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with your own heart's blood.

You must sing to me with your breast against a thorn.

All night long you must sing to me, and the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood must flow into my veins, and become mine."

"Death is a great price to pay for a red rose," cried the Nightingale, "and Life is very dear to all.

It is pleasant to sit in the green wood, and to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot of pearl.

Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the bluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the hill.

Yet love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird compared to the heart of a man?"

So she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.

She swept over the garden like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed through the grove.

The young Student was still lying on the grass, where she had left him, and the tears were not drying in his beautiful eyes.

"Be happy," cried the Nightingale, "be happy, you shall have your red rose.

I will build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with my own heart's blood.

All I ask is that you will be a true lover.

The Student looked up from the grass, and listened, but he could not understand what the Nightingale was saying to him, for he only knew the things that are written in books.

But the Oak-tree understood, and felt sad, for he was very fond of the little Nightingale, who had built her nest in his branches.

"Sing me one last song," he whispered; "I shall feel very lonely when you are gone."

So the Nightingale sang to the Oak-tree, and her voice was like water bubbling from a silver jar.

When she had finished her song, the Student got up, and went into his room, and lay down on his little pallet-bed, and began to think of his love; and, after a time, he fell asleep.

And when the moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to the Rose-tree, and set her breast against the thorn.

All night long she sang, with her breast against the thorn, and the cold crystal Moon leaned down and listened.

All night long she sang, and the thorn went deeper and deeper, and her life-blood ebbed away from her.

And on the topmost spray of the Rose-tree there blossomed a marvelous rose, petal following petal, as song followed song.

Pale was it, at first, as the mist that hangs over the river, pale as the feet of the morning, and silver as the wings of the dawn.

As the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver, as the shadow of a rose in a water-pool, so was the rose that blossomed on the topmost spray of the Tree.

But the Tree cried to the Nightingale "Press closer, little Nightingale," cried the Tree, "or the Day will come before the rose is finished."

So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and louder and louder grew her song.

And a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like the flush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the bride.

But the thorn had not yet reached her heart, so the rose's heart remained white, for only a Nightingale's heart's blood can crimson the heart of a rose.

And the Tree cried to the Nightingale.

"Press closer, little Nightingale," cried the Tree, "or the Day will come before the rose is finished."

So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the thorn touched her heart, and a fierce pang of pain shot through her.

Bitter, bitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song.

And the marvelous rose became crimson, like the rose of the eastern sky.

Crimson was the girdle of petals, and crimson as a ruby was the heart.

But the Nightingale's voice grew fainter, and her little wings began to beat, and a film came over her eyes.

Fainter and fainter grew her song, and she felt something choking her in her throat.

Then she gave one last burst of music.

The white Moon heard it, and she forgot the dawn, and lingered on in the sky.

The red rose heard it, and it trembled all over with ecstasy, and opened its petals to the cold morning air.

"Look, look! " cried the Tree, "the rose is finished now."

but the Nightingale made not answer, for she was lying dead in the long grass, with the thorn in her heart.

And at noon the Student opened his window and looked out.

"Why, what a wonderful piece of luck! "

He cried "A red rose!

I have never seen any rose like it in all my life. "

and he leaned down and plucked it.

Then he put on his hat, and ran up to the Professor's house with the rose in his hand.

The daughter of the Professor was sitting in the doorway winding blue silk on a reel, and her little dog was lying at her feet.

"You said that you would dance with me if I brought you a red rose," cried the Student.

"Here is the reddest rose in all the world.

You will wear it tonight next your heart, and as we dance together it will tell you how I love you."

But the girl frowned.

"I am afraid it will not go with my dress," she answered; "besides, the Chamberlain's nephew had sent me some real jewels, and everybody knows that jewels cost far more than flowers."

"Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful," said the Student angrily.

and he threw the rose onto he street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cartwheel went over it.

"Ungrateful!" said the girl.

"I tell you what, you are very rude; and, after all, who are you?

Only a Student.

Why, I dont believe you have even got silver buckles to your shoes as the Chamberlain's nephew has;" and she got up from her chair and went into the house.

"What a silly thing Love is! " said the Student as he walked away.

"it is always telling one of things that are not going to happen, and making one believe things that are not true.

In fact, it is quite unpractical, and, I shall go back to Philosophy."

So he returned to his room and pulled out a great dusty book, and began to read.

Americans no longer expect public figures,whether in speech or in writing, to command the English language with skill and gift.

Nor do they aspire to such command themselves.

In his latest book, Doing Our Own Thing: The Degradation of Language and Music and Why We Should,Like,Care,John McWhorter,a linguist and controversialist of mixed liberal and conservative views, sees the triumph of 1960s counter-culture as responsible for the decline of formal English.

Blaming the permissive 1960s is nothing new, but this is not yet another criticism against the decline in education.

Mr. McWhorter's academic specialty is language history and change, and he sees the gradual disappearance of "whom",for example, to be natural and no more regrettable than the loss of the case-endings of Old English.

But the cult of the authentic and the personal,"doing our own thing", has spelt the death of formal speech,writing,poetry and music.

While even the modestly educated sought an elevated tone when they put pen to paper before the 1960s, even the most well regarded writing since then has sought to capture spoken English on the page.

Equally,in poetry,the highly personal, performative genre is the only form that could claim real liveliness.

In both oral and written English,talking is triumphing over speaking,spontaneity over craft.

Illustrated with an entertaining array of examples from both high and low culture, the trend that Mr. McWhorter documents is unmistakable.

But it is less clear,to take the question of his subtitle,why we should, like,care.

As a linguist,he acknowledges that all varieties of human language, including non-standard ones like Black English, can be powerfully expressive —— there exists no language or dialect in the world that cannot convey complex ideas.

He is not arguing,as many do, that we can no longer think straight because we do not talk proper.

Russians have a deep love for their own language and carry large chunks of memorized poetry in their heads,while Italian politicians tend to elaborate speech that would seem old-fashioned to most English-speakers.

Mr. McWhorter acknowledges that formal language is not strictly necessary, and proposes no radical education reforms —— he is really grieving over the loss of something beautiful more than useful.

We now take our English "on paper plates instead of china."A shame,perhaps, but probably an inevitable one.

Of all the components of a good night's sleep, dreams seem to be least within our control.

In dreams, a window opens into a world where logic is suspended and dead people speak.

A century ago, Freud formulated his revolutionary theory that dreams were the disguised shadows of our unconscious desires and fears;by the late 1970s, neurologists had switched to thinking of them as just "mental noise" —— the random byproducts of the neuralrepair work that goes on during sleep.

Now researchers suspect that dreams are part of the mind's emotional thermostat, regulating moods while the brain is "off-line." And one leading authority says that these intensely powerful mental events can be not only harnessed but actually brought under conscious control,to help us sleep and feel better.

"It's your dream," says Rosalind Cartwright,chair of psychology at Chicago's Medical Center.

"If you don't like it,change it."Evidence from brain imaging supports this view.

The brain is as active during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep —— when most vivid dreams occur —— as it is when fully awake,says Dr. Eric Nofzinger at the University of Pittsburgh.

But not all parts of the brain are equally involved; the limbic system (the "emotional brain") is especially active,while the prefrontal cortex (the center of intellect and reasoning) is relatively quiet.

"We wake up from dreams happy or depressed, and those feelings can stay with us all day," says Stanford sleep researcher Dr. William Dement.

The link between dreams and emotions shows up among the patients in Cartwright's clinic.

Most people seem to have more bad dreams early in the night, progressing toward happier ones before awakening,suggesting that they are working through negative feelings generated during the day.

Because our conscious mind is occupied with daily life we don't always think about the emotional significance of the day's events —— until,it appears,we begin to dream.

And this process need not be left to the unconscious.

Cartwright believes one can exercise conscious control over recurring bad dreams. As soon as you awaken,identify what is upsetting about the dream.

Visualize how you would like it to end instead;the next time it occurs, try to wake up just enough to control its course.

With much practice people can learn to,literally,do it in their sleep.

At the end of the day, there's probably little reason to pay attention to our dreams at all unless they keep us from sleeping or "we wake up in a panic," Cartwright says.

Terrorism,economic uncertainties and general feelings of insecurity have increased people's anxiety.

Those suffering from persistent nightmares should seek help from a therapist.

For the rest of us,the brain has its ways of working through bad feelings.

Sleep —— or rather dream —— on it and you'll feel better in the morning.

Do you remember all those years when scientists argued that smoking would kill us but the doubters insisted that we didn't know for sure?

That the evidence was inconclusive,the science uncertain?

That the antismoking lobby was out to destroy our way of life and the government should stay out of the way?

Lots of Americans bought that nonsense,and over three decades, some 10 million smokers went to early graves.

There are upsetting parallels today, as scientists in one wave after another try to awaken us to the growing threat of global warming.

The latest was a panel from the National Academy of Sciences, enlisted by the White House, to tell us that the Earth's atmosphere is definitely warming and that the problem is largely man-made.

The clear message is that we should get moving to protect ourselves.

The president of the National Academy,Bruce Alberts, added this key point in the preface to the panel's report: "Science never has all the answers.

But science does provide us with the best available guide to the future, and it is critical that our nation and the world base important policies on the best judgments that science can provide concerning the future consequences of present actions."Just as on smoking, voices now come from many quarters insisting that the science about global warming is incomplete,that it's OK to keep pouring fumes into the air until we know for sure.

This is a dangerous game: by the time 100 percent of the evidence is in, it may be too late.

With the risks obvious and growing, a prudent people would take out an insurance policy now.

Fortunately,the White House is starting to pay attention.

But it's obvious that a majority of the president's advisers still don't take global warming seriously.

Instead of a plan of action, they continue to press for more research —— a classic case of "paralysis by analysis."To serve as responsible stewards of the planet, we must press forward on deeper atmospheric and oceanic research.

But research alone is inadequate.

If the Administration won't take the legislative initiative, Congress should help to begin fashioning conservation measures.

A bill by Democratic Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, which would offer financial incentives for private industry,is a promising start.

Many see that the country is getting ready to build lots of new power plants to meet our energy needs.

If we are ever going to protect the atmosphere, it is crucial that those new plants be environmentally sound.

Everybody loves a fat pay rise.

Yet pleasure at your own can vanish if you learn that a colleague has been given a bigger one.

Indeed,if he has a reputation for slacking,you might even be outraged.

Such behaviour is regarded as "all too human", with the underlying assumption that other animals would not be capable of this finely developed sense of grievance.

But a study by Sarah Brosnan and Frans de Waal of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia,which has just been published in Nature,suggests that it is all too monkey, as well.

The researchers studied the behaviour of female brown capuchin monkeys.

They look cute.

They are good-natured,co-operative creatures,and they share their food readily.

Above all,like their female human counterparts, they tend to pay much closer attention to the value of "goods and services" than males.

Such characteristics make them perfect candidates for Dr. Brosnan's and Dr. de Waal's study.

The researchers spent two years teaching their monkeys to exchange tokens for food.

Normally,the monkeys were happy enough to exchange pieces of rock for slices of cucumber.

However,when two monkeys were placed in separate but adjoining chambers, so that each could observe what the other was getting in return for its rock,their behaviour became markedly different.

In the world of capuchins,grapes are luxury goods (and much preferable to cucumbers).

So when one monkey was handed a grape in exchange for her token, the second was reluctant to hand hers over for a mere piece of cucumber.

And if one received a grape without having to provide her token in exchange at all,the other either tossed her own token at the researcher or out of the chamber, or refused to accept the slice of cucumber.

Indeed, the mere presence of a grape in the other chamber (without an actual monkey to eat it) was enough to induce resentment in a female capuchin.

The researchers suggest that capuchin monkeys,like humans,are guided by social emotions.

In the wild,they are a co-operative,group-living species.

Such cooperation is likely to be stable only when each animal feels it is not being cheated.

Feelings of righteous indignation,it seems,are not the preserve of people alone.

Refusing a lesser reward completely makes these feelings abundantly clear to other members of the group.

However,whether such a sense of fairness evolved independently in capuchins and humans, or whether it stems from the common ancestor that the species had 35 million years ago,is,as yet,an unanswered question.





#### 66. The legend of zelda: Breath of the wild - The complete Official Guide:Foreword

In re-examining the convention that *Zelda* games are played on a set path, we decided to implement a groundbreaking new play style that would allow players to go wherever and do whatever they want. This has been achieved for the first time in the history of the series in its newest edition, *Breath of the Wild*. In order to attain this goal, we spent most of the production time creating the game as we
played it.

The process of “creating while playing” went like this: first, we placed a countless number of “points” throughout the vast world of *Breath of the Wild*. Then, as we went through and actually played the game, we would make those “points” larger, smaller, or move them around, incorporating the things that we felt, while playing deeper into the game itself. In truth, this production style is very similar to the method Miyamoto used in the very first *The Legend of Zelda*. Nonetheless, as games became 3D and people wanted more realism from game worlds, it became necessary to have a concrete “blueprint” of our game world from the very start of development. In essence, what became known as the quintessential *Zelda* experience, following a path set by the developers from start to finish, ended up being a product of the demands placed on the developers by that blueprint.

However, since this approach of creating a game while actually playing it means that the game continues to grow and evolve over time, it makes it very difficult to decide where to place the ending. Even now, after development has finished, I still get the feeling that there are so many things left that we didn’t get a chance to achieve. Although this feeling isn’t new to this particular work, for past games, it was more a feeling of disappointment. For this game, in contrast, it’s more of a desire to keep evolving and growing. I feel like that’s a big difference between this Zelda game and previous versions.

I’m not sure what lies before us, but I’m positive that this feeling of wanting to keep on growing and changing will be a driving force for future *Zelda* games. I hope you’ll keep your eye out for whatever comes next in *Zelda*.

Producer, *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*





The *Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* is a project that we started in an effort to completely re-imagine the conventions of *The Legend of Zelda* to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the series. I tried to imagine what that would look like: a new *Legend of Zelda*, utilizing new technology, new hardware, and new ways of playing that we had never done before. I contemplated this for a long time, and my staff and I spent day after day trying to come up with an answer, but for what seemed an age, we couldn’t find one.

When we went back to the essence of what it was that originally made *The Legend of Zelda* so much fun, we realized the answer was in the very first *Zelda* game: venturing through wide open fields, using your imagination and trying out different approaches in order to overcome problems… Was this the answer? Was this the essence of *The Legend of Zelda*? What if we tried making a game where there was a response to every single one of the player’s actions? What would we need in order to make that happen? After we started asking ourselves these questions, we came up with a vast variety of playstyles that served as the basis for everything that was implemented in the finished version of *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*.

Most of the natural phenomena that occur in the world of *Breath of the Wild* are based on physics, and they affect all forms of life that appear in the game. In addition, depending on the choices and actions of the player or the effects from the items that they use, there are various kinds of reactions that can occur. Due to the mass of possible combinations, we have on occasion observed things happen in the field that not even we, who created the game, could have imagined. For this reason, there is no one way to beat this game. In *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*, the number of ways that you can tackle and solve any problem is limited only by your imagination.

Unique characters, powerful enemies, and challenging puzzles that can only be found in the world of *The Legend of Zelda* are waiting for you. This time, our hero Link uses an item called the Sheikah Slate to aid him in his adventures, but with this strategy guide by your side, I hope that you too will be able to venture forth with confidence into the vast world of Hyrule and experience your own adventure to the fullest.

#### 67. Robinson Crusoe (Chapter I—Start in Life)

I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good family, though not of that country, my father being a foreigner of Bremen, who settled first at Hull. He got a good estate by merchandise, and leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at York, from whence he had married my mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very good family in that country, and from whom I was called Robinson Kreutznaer; but, by the usual corruption of words in England, we are now called—nay we call ourselves and write our name—Crusoe; and so my companions always called me.

I had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an English regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous Colonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk against the Spaniards. What became of my second brother I never knew, any more than my father or mother knew what became of me.

Being the third son of the family and not bred to any trade, my head began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts. My father, who was very ancient, had given me a competent share of learning, as far as house-education and a country free school generally go, and designed me for the law; but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea; and my inclination to this led me so strongly against the will, nay, the commands of my father, and against all the entreaties and persuasions of my mother and other friends, that there seemed to be something fatal in that propensity of nature, tending directly to the life of misery which was to befall me.

My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent c against what he foresaw was my design. He called me one morning into his chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and expostulated very warmly with me upon this subject. He asked me what reasons, more than a mere wandering inclination, I had for leaving father's house and my native country, where I might be well introduced, and had a prospect of raising my fortune by application and industry, with a life of ease and pleasure. He told me it was men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring, superior fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon adventures, to rise by enterprise, and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature out of the common road; that these things were all either too far above me or too far below me; that mine was the middle state, or what might be called the upper station of low life, which he had found, by long experience, was the best state in the world, the most suited to human happiness, not exposed to the miseries and hardships, the labour and sufferings of the mechanic part of mankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy of the upper part of mankind. He told me I might judge of the happiness of this state by this one thing—viz. that this was the state of life which all other people envied; that kings have frequently lamented the miserable consequence of being born to great things, and wished they had been placed in the middle of the two extremes, between the mean and the great; that the wise man gave his testimony to this, as the standard of felicity, when he prayed to have neither poverty nor riches.

He bade me observe it, and I should always find that the calamities of life were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind, but that the middle station had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind; nay, they were not subjected to so many distempers and uneasinesses, either of body or mind, as those were who, by vicious living, luxury, and extravagances on the one hand, or by hard labour, want of necessaries, and mean or insufficient diet on the other hand, bring distemper upon themselves by the natural consequences of their way of living; that the middle station of life was calculated for all kind of virtue and all kind of enjoyments; that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a middle fortune; that temperance, moderation, quietness, health, society, all agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were the blessings attending the middle station of life; that this way men went silently and smoothly through the world, and comfortably out of it, not embarrassed with the labours of the hands or of the head, not sold to a life of slavery for daily bread, nor harassed with perplexed circumstances, which rob the soul of peace and the body of rest, nor enraged with the passion of envy, or the secret burning lust of ambition for great things; but, in easy circumstances, sliding gently through the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living, without the bitter; feeling that they are happy, and learning by every day's experience to know it more sensibly.

After this he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affectionate manner, not to play the young man, nor to precipitate myself into miseries which nature, and the station of life I was born in, seemed to have provided against; that I was under no necessity of seeking my bread; that he would do well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly into the station of life which he had just been recommending to me; and that if I was not very easy and happy in the world, it must be my mere fate or fault that must hinder it; and that he should have nothing to answer for, having thus discharged his duty in warning me against measures which he knew would be to my hurt; in a word, that as he would do very kind things for me if I would stay and settle at home as he directed, so he would not have so much hand in my misfortunes as to give me any encouragement to go away; and to close all, he told me I had my elder brother for an example, to whom he had used the same earnest persuasions to keep him from going into the Low Country wars, but could not prevail, his young desires prompting him to run into the army, where he was killed; and though he said he would not cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I did take this foolish step, God would not bless me, and I should have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when there might be none to assist in my recovery.

I observed in this last part of his discourse, which was truly prophetic, though I suppose my father did not know it to be so himself—I say, I observed the tears run down his face very plentifully, especially when he spoke of my brother who was killed: and that when he spoke of my having leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he was so moved that he broke off the discourse, and told me his heart was so full he could say no more to me.

I was sincerely affected with this discourse, and, indeed, who could be otherwise? and I resolved not to think of going abroad any more, but to settle at home according to my father's desire. But alas! a few days wore it all off; and, in short, to prevent any of my father's further importunities, in a few weeks after I resolved to run quite away from him. However, I did not act quite so hastily as the first heat of my resolution prompted; but I took my mother at a time when I thought her a little more pleasant than ordinary, and told her that my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the world that I should never settle to anything with resolution enough to go through with it, and my father had better give me his consent than force me to go without it; that I was now eighteen years old, which was too late to go apprentice to a trade or clerk to an attorney; that I was sure if I did I should never serve out my time, but I should certainly run away from my master before my time was out, and go to sea; and if she would speak to my father to let me go one voyage abroad, if I came home again, and did not like it, I would go no more; and I would promise, by a double diligence, to recover the time that I had lost.

This put my mother into a great passion; she told me she knew it would be to no purpose to speak to my father upon any such subject; that he knew too well what was my interest to give his consent to anything so much for my hurt; and that she wondered how I could think of any such thing after the discourse I had had with my father, and such kind and tender expressions as she knew my father had used to me; and that, in short, if I would ruin myself, there was no help for me; but I might depend I should never have their consent to it; that for her part she would not have so much hand in my destruction; and I should never have it to say that my mother was willing when my father was not.

Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet I heard afterwards that she reported all the discourse to him, and that my father, after showing a great concern at it, said to her, with a sigh, "That boy might be happy if he would stay at home; but if he goes abroad, he will be the most miserable wretch that ever was born: I can give no consent to it."

It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose, though, in the meantime, I continued obstinately deaf to all proposals of settling to business, and frequently expostulated with my father and mother about their being so positively determined against what they knew my inclinations prompted me to. But being one day at Hull, where I went casually, and without any purpose of making an elopement at that time; but, I say, being there, and one of my companions being about to sail to London in his father's ship, and prompting me to go with them with the common allurement of seafaring men, that it should cost me nothing for my passage, I consulted neither father nor mother any more, nor so much as sent them word of it; but leaving them to hear of it as they might, without asking God's blessing or my father's, without any consideration of circumstances or consequences, and in an ill hour, God knows, on the 1st of September 1651, I went on board a ship bound for London. Never any young adventurer's misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or continued longer than mine. The ship was no sooner out of the Humber than the wind began to blow and the sea to rise in a most frightful manner; and, as I had never been at sea before, I was most inexpressibly sick in body and terrified in mind. I began now seriously to reflect upon what I had done, and how justly I was overtaken by the judgment of Heaven for my wicked leaving my father's house, and abandoning my duty. All the good counsels of my parents, my father's tears and my mother's entreaties, came now fresh into my mind; and my conscience, which was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to which it has since, reproached me with the contempt of advice, and the breach of my duty to God and my father.

All this while the storm increased, and the sea went very high, though nothing like what I have seen many times since; no, nor what I saw a few days after; but it was enough to affect me then, who was but a young sailor, and had never known anything of the matter. I expected every wave would have swallowed us up, and that every time the ship fell down, as I thought it did, in the trough or hollow of the sea, we should never rise more; in this agony of mind, I made many vows and resolutions that if it would please God to spare my life in this one voyage, if ever I got once my foot upon dry land again, I would go directly home to my father, and never set it into a ship again while I lived; that I would take his advice, and never run myself into such miseries as these any more. Now I saw plainly the goodness of his observations about the middle station of life, how easy, how comfortably he had lived all his days, and never had been exposed to tempests at sea or troubles on shore; and I resolved that I would, like a true repenting prodigal, go home to my father.



These wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the storm lasted, and indeed some time after; but the next day the wind was abated, and the sea calmer, and I began to be a little inured to it; however, I was very grave for all that day, being also a little sea-sick still; but towards night the weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a charming fine evening followed; the sun went down perfectly clear, and rose so the next morning; and having little or no wind, and a smooth sea, the sun shining upon it, the sight was, as I thought, the most delightful that ever I saw.

I had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-sick, but very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea that was so rough and terrible the day before, and could be so calm and so pleasant in so little a time after. And now, lest my good resolutions should continue, my companion, who had enticed me away, comes to me; "Well, Bob," says he, clapping me upon the shoulder, "how do you do after it? I warrant you were frighted, wer'n't you, last night, when it blew but a capful of wind?" "A capful d'you call it?" said I; "'twas a terrible storm." "A storm, you fool you," replies he; "do you call that a storm? why, it was nothing at all; give us but a good ship and sea-room, and we think nothing of such a squall of wind as that; but you're but a fresh-water sailor, Bob. Come, let us make a bowl of punch, and we'll forget all that; d'ye see what charming weather 'tis now?" To make short this sad part of my story, we went the way of all sailors; the punch was made and I was made half drunk with it: and in that one night's wickedness I drowned all my repentance, all my reflections upon my past conduct, all my resolutions for the future. In a word, as the sea was returned to its smoothness of surface and settled calmness by the abatement of that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts being over, my fears and apprehensions of being swallowed up by the sea being forgotten, and the current of my former desires returned, I entirely forgot the vows and promises that I made in my distress. I found, indeed, some intervals of reflection; and the serious thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to return again sometimes; but I shook them off, and roused myself from them as it were from a distemper, and applying myself to drinking and company, soon mastered the return of those fits—for so I called them; and I had in five or six days got as complete a victory over conscience as any young fellow that resolved not to be troubled with it could desire. But I was to have another trial for it still; and Providence, as in such cases generally it does, resolved to leave me entirely without excuse; for if I would not take this for a deliverance, the next was to be such a one as the worst and most hardened wretch among us would confess both the danger and the mercy of.

The sixth day of our being at sea we came into Yarmouth Roads; the wind having been contrary and the weather calm, we had made but little way since the storm. Here we were obliged to come to an anchor, and here we lay, the wind continuing contrary—viz. at south-west—for seven or eight days, during which time a great many ships from Newcastle came into the same Roads, as the common harbour where the ships might wait for a wind for the river.

We had not, however, rid here so long but we should have tided it up the river, but that the wind blew too fresh, and after we had lain four or five days, blew very hard. However, the Roads being reckoned as good as a harbour, the anchorage good, and our ground-tackle very strong, our men were unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive of danger, but spent the time in rest and mirth, after the manner of the sea; but the eighth day, in the morning, the wind increased, and we had all hands at work to strike our topmasts, and make everything snug and close, that the ship might ride as easy as possible. By noon the sea went very high indeed, and our ship rode forecastle in, shipped several seas, and we thought once or twice our anchor had come home; upon which our master ordered out the sheet-anchor, so that we rode with two anchors ahead, and the cables veered out to the bitter end.



By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and now I began to see terror and amazement in the faces even of the seamen themselves. The master, though vigilant in the business of preserving the ship, yet as he went in and out of his cabin by me, I could hear him softly to himself say, several times, "Lord be merciful to us! we shall be all lost! we shall be all undone!" and the like. During these first hurries I was stupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in the steerage, and cannot describe my temper: I could ill resume the first penitence which I had so apparently trampled upon and hardened myself against: I thought the bitterness of death had been past, and that this would be nothing like the first; but when the master himself came by me, as I said just now, and said we should be all lost, I was dreadfully frighted. I got up out of my cabin and looked out; but such a dismal sight I never saw: the sea ran mountains high, and broke upon us every three or four minutes; when I could look about, I could see nothing but distress round us; two ships that rode near us, we found, had cut their masts by the board, being deep laden; and our men cried out that a ship which rode about a mile ahead of us was foundered. Two more ships, being driven from their anchors, were run out of the Roads to sea, at all adventures, and that with not a mast standing. The light ships fared the best, as not so much labouring in the sea; but two or three of them drove, and came close by us, running away with only their spritsail out before the wind.



Towards evening the mate and boatswain begged the master of our ship to let them cut away the fore-mast, which he was very unwilling to do; but the boatswain protesting to him that if he did not the ship would founder, he consented; and when they had cut away the fore-mast, the main-mast stood so loose, and shook the ship so much, they were obliged to cut that away also, and make a clear deck.

Any one may judge what a condition I must be in at all this, who was but a young sailor, and who had been in such a fright before at but a little. But if I can express at this distance the thoughts I had about me at that time, I was in tenfold more horror of mind upon account of my former convictions, and the having returned from them to the resolutions I had wickedly taken at first, than I was at death itself; and these, added to the terror of the storm, put me into such a condition that I can by no words describe it. But the worst was not come yet; the storm continued with such fury that the seamen themselves acknowledged they had never seen a worse. We had a good ship, but she was deep laden, and wallowed in the sea, so that the seamen every now and then cried out she would founder. It was my advantage in one respect, that I did not know what they meant by *founder* till I inquired. However, the storm was so violent that I saw, what is not often seen, the master, the boatswain, and some others more sensible than the rest, at their prayers, and expecting every moment when the ship would go to the bottom. In the middle of the night, and under all the rest of our distresses, one of the men that had been down to see cried out we had sprung a leak; another said there was four feet water in the hold. Then all hands were called to the pump. At that word, my heart, as I thought, died within me: and I fell backwards upon the side of my bed where I sat, into the cabin. However, the men roused me, and told me that I, that was able to do nothing before, was as well able to pump as another; at which I stirred up and went to the pump, and worked very heartily. While this was doing the master, seeing some light colliers, who, not able to ride out the storm were obliged to slip and run away to sea, and would come near us, ordered to fire a gun as a signal of distress. I, who knew nothing what they meant, thought the ship had broken, or some dreadful thing happened. In a word, I was so surprised that I fell down in a swoon. As this was a time when everybody had his own life to think of, nobody minded me, or what was become of me; but another man stepped up to the pump, and thrusting me aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking I had been dead; and it was a great while before I came to myself.



We worked on; but the water increasing in the hold, it was apparent that the ship would founder; and though the storm began to abate a little, yet it was not possible she could swim till we might run into any port; so the master continued firing guns for help; and a light ship, who had rid it out just ahead of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It was with the utmost hazard the boat came near us; but it was impossible for us to get on board, or for the boat to lie near the ship's side, till at last the men rowing very heartily, and venturing their lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope over the stern with a buoy to it, and then veered it out a great length, which they, after much labour and hazard, took hold of, and we hauled them close under our stern, and got all into their boat. It was to no purpose for them or us, after we were in the boat, to think of reaching their own ship; so all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in towards shore as much as we could; and our master promised them, that if the boat was staved upon shore, he would make it good to their master: so partly rowing and partly driving, our boat went away to the northward, sloping towards the shore almost as far as Winterton Ness.



We were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our ship till we saw her sink, and then I understood for the first time what was meant by a ship foundering in the sea. I must acknowledge I had hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told me she was sinking; for from the moment that they rather put me into the boat than that I might be said to go in, my heart was, as it were, dead within me, partly with fright, partly with horror of mind, and the thoughts of what was yet before me.

While we were in this condition—the men yet labouring at the oar to bring the boat near the shore—we could see (when, our boat mounting the waves, we were able to see the shore) a great many people running along the strand to assist us when we should come near; but we made but slow way towards the shore; nor were we able to reach the shore till, being past the lighthouse at Winterton, the shore falls off to the westward towards Cromer, and so the land broke off a little the violence of the wind. Here we got in, and though not without much difficulty, got all safe on shore, and walked afterwards on foot to Yarmouth, where, as unfortunate men, we were used with great humanity, as well by the magistrates of the town, who assigned us good quarters, as by particular merchants and owners of ships, and had money given us sufficient to carry us either to London or back to Hull as we thought fit.



Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull, and have gone home, I had been happy, and my father, as in our blessed Saviour's parable, had even killed the fatted calf for me; for hearing the ship I went away in was cast away in Yarmouth Roads, it was a great while before he had any assurances that I was not drowned.

But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that nothing could resist; and though I had several times loud calls from my reason and my more composed judgment to go home, yet I had no power to do it. I know not what to call this, nor will I urge that it is a secret overruling decree, that hurries us on to be the instruments of our own destruction, even though it be before us, and that we rush upon it with our eyes open. Certainly, nothing but some such decreed unavoidable misery, which it was impossible for me to escape, could have pushed me forward against the calm reasonings and persuasions of my most retired thoughts, and against two such visible instructions as I had met with in my first attempt.



My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and who was the master's son, was now less forward than I. The first time he spoke to me after we were at Yarmouth, which was not till two or three days, for we were separated in the town to several quarters; I say, the first time he saw me, it appeared his tone was altered; and, looking very melancholy, and shaking his head, he asked me how I did, and telling his father who I was, and how I had come this voyage only for a trial, in order to go further abroad, his father, turning to me with a very grave and concerned tone "Young man," says he, "you ought never to go to sea any more; you ought to take this for a plain and visible token that you are not to be a seafaring man." "Why, sir," said I, "will you go to sea no more?" "That is another case," said he; "it is my calling, and therefore my duty; but as you made this voyage on trial, you see what a taste Heaven has given you of what you are to expect if you persist. Perhaps this has all befallen us on your account, like Jonah in the ship of Tarshish. Pray," continues he, "what are you; and on what account did you go to sea?" Upon that I told him some of my story; at the end of which he burst out into a strange kind of passion: "What had I done," says he, "that such an unhappy wretch should come into my ship? I would not set my foot in the same ship with thee again for a thousand pounds." This indeed was, as I said, an excursion of his spirits, which were yet agitated by the sense of his loss, and was farther than he could have authority to go. However, he afterwards talked very gravely to me, exhorting me to go back to my father, and not tempt Providence to my ruin, telling me I might see a visible hand of Heaven against me. "And, young man," said he, "depend upon it, if you do not go back, wherever you go, you will meet with nothing but disasters and disappointments, till your father's words are fulfilled upon you."



We parted soon after; for I made him little answer, and I saw him no more; which way he went I knew not. As for me, having some money in my pocket, I travelled to London by land; and there, as well as on the road, had many struggles with myself what course of life I should take, and whether I should go home or to sea.

As to going home, shame opposed the best motions that offered to my thoughts, and it immediately occurred to me how I should be laughed at among the neighbours, and should be ashamed to see, not my father and mother only, but even everybody else; from whence I have since often observed, how incongruous and irrational the common temper of mankind is, especially of youth, to that reason which ought to guide them in such cases—viz. that they are not ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed to repent; not ashamed of the action for which they ought justly to be esteemed fools, but are ashamed of the returning, which only can make them be esteemed wise men.

In this state of life, however, I remained some time, uncertain what measures to take, and what course of life to lead. An irresistible reluctance continued to going home; and as I stayed away a while, the remembrance of the distress I had been in wore off, and as that abated, the little motion I had in my desires to return wore off with it, till at last I quite laid aside the thoughts of it, and looked out for a voyage.

Tree planting now dominates political and popular agendas and is often presented as an easy answer to the climate crisis, as well as a way for business corporations to offset their carbon emissions.

But unfortunately, tree planting isn't as straightforward as some people think.

When the wrong trees are planted in the wrong place, it can do considerably more damage than good, failing to help either people or the environment.

Reforestation projects are currently being undertaken on a huge scale in many countries and it's crucial that the right trees are selected.

A mix of species should always be planted, typical of the local natural forest ecosystem and including rare and endangered species in order to create a rich ecosystem.

It's important to avoid non-native species that could become invasive.

Invasive species are a significant contributor to the current global biodiversity crisis and are often in competition with native species and may threaten their long-term survival.

Restoring biodiversity that will maximise carbon capture is key when reforesting an area, but ideally any reforestation project should have several goals.

These could include selecting trees that can contribute to wildlife conservation, improve the availability of food for the local community and maintain the stability of soil systems.

Meeting as many of these goals as possible, whilst doing no harm to local communities, native ecosystems and vulnerable species, is the sign of a highly successful tree-planting scheme.

To ensure the survival and resilience of a planted forest, it's vital to use tree seeds with appropriate levels of genetic diversity: the amount of genetic variation found within a species essential for their survival.

Using seeds with low genetic diversity generally lowers the resilience of restored forests, which can make them vulnerable to disease and unable to adapt to climate change.

Choosing the right location for reforestation projects is as important as choosing the right trees.

Ultimately, the best area for planting trees would be in formerly forested areas that are in poor condition.

It's better to avoid non-forested landscapes such as natural grasslands, savannas or wetlands as these ecosystems already contribute greatly to capturing carbon.

It would also be advantageous to choose an area where trees could provide other benefits, such as recreational spaces.

Reforesting areas which are currently exploited for agriculture should be avoided as this often leads to other areas being deforested.

Large-scale reforestation projects require careful planning.

Making the right decisions about where to plant trees depends on having the right information.

Having detailed and up-to-date maps identifying high-priority areas for intervention is essential.

Drone technology is a useful tool in helping to prioritise and monitor areas of degraded forest for restoration.

In Brazil, it's being used to identify and quantify how parts of the Amazon are being devastated by human activities such as rearing cattle and illegal logging.

A good example of where the right trees were picked to achieve a restored forest is in Lampang Province in Northern Thailand.

A previously forested site which had been degraded through mining was reforested by a cement company together with Chiang Mai University.

After spreading 60 cm of topsoil, they planted 14 different native tree species which included several species of fig.

Figs are a keystone species because of the critical role they play in maintaining wildlife populations.

They are central to tropical reforestation projects as they accelerate the speed of the recovery process by attracting animals and birds which act as natural seed dispersers.

This helps to promote diversity through the healthy regrowth of a wide range of plant species.

Unlike the majority of fruit trees, figs bear fruit all year round, providing a reliable food source for many species.

At this site, for example, after only three rainy seasons, monkeys started visiting to eat the fig fruits, naturally dispersing seeds through defecation.

Reforestation projects should always aim to make sure that local communities are consulted and involved in the decision-making process.

The restoration of mangrove forests in Madagascar is an example of a project which has succeeded in creating real benefits for the community.

Destruction of the mangrove forests had a terrible impact on plant and animal life, and also badly affected the fishing industry, which was a major source of employment for local people living in coastal areas.

The reforestation project involved hiring local people to plant and care for the new mangrove trees.

Millions of mangrove trees have now been planted which has resulted in the return of a healthy aquatic ecosystem.

The mangroves also act as a defence against the increased threat of flooding caused by climate change.

What's more, the local economy is more stable and thousands more Madagascans are now able to send their children to school.

One other important point to consider . . .

KAEDEN: Hello Charlotte. I'm Kaeden, one of the supervisors. Welcome to the team.

CHARLOTTE: Hi Aiden.

KAEDEN: It's Kaeden.

CHARLOTTE: I'm so sorry.

KAEDEN: Don't worry. People often get my name wrong; they never know how to spell it.

It's K-A-E-D-E-N, in case you ever need to write it.

CHARLOTTE: I'll try and remember.

KAEDEN: So, there are a few practical things you need to sort out this morning.

Then I'll show you what you're going to do today.

CHARLOTTE: The email I received said to go to the front desk, to show my letter of appointment and pick up my badge.

KAEDEN: You'll need that for the staffroom and other areas of the supermarket where shoppers aren't allowed.

So, after you've finished at the front desk, I'll take you to the staffroom.

Put your coat and rucksack in one of the lockers there. Take whichever one is free.

CHARLOTTE: Will I have a key?

KAEDEN: Yes. Try not to lose it. At the end of the day, leave it in the door for the next person to use.

CHARLOTTE: Will do.

KAEDEN: You also need to go to the HR department to see Tiffany. She's really helpful.

CHARLOTTE: I was told to bring my passport with me. HR need to take a note of the number in it.

KAEDEN: That's right. Or you can show your ID card.

CHARLOTTE: I don't have one of those.

KAEDEN: OK. Tiffany will give you a uniform.

They have lots in different sizes, so you just tell her what you need.

I won't come with you to HR – I've got to go and sort something else out. Problem with a bread slicer.

CHARLOTTE: Is the HR office near the staffroom?

KAEDEN: The staffroom's on the first floor, and HR are a couple of floors above that, on the third floor. There's a staircase outside the staffroom.

CHARLOTTE: OK.

KAEDEN: When you've finished with HR, come and find me in the bakery section of the shop.

CHARLOTTE: I'm looking forward to getting started.

KAEDEN: I'll just give you my phone number, in case you can't find me. Have you got your phone there?

CHARLOTTE: Yes . . . OK, ready.

KAEDEN: It's oh-four-one-two double-six-five nine-oh-three.

CHARLOTTE: OK, done.

KAEDEN: So, Charlotte, your tasks today are in the bakery section, on the sushi counter, and on the meat and fish counters.

The first job is to check sell-by dates on the bread and cakes.

If any of the dates are today's, put a new price label on the packaging.

CHARLOTTE: What if any of the labels are yesterday's dates, or older?

Do I throw those items away?

KAEDEN: Yes, but that shouldn't happen – we check the stock every day.

When something needs a new price label, put a yellow one on the package, next to the original price.

CHARLOTTE: OK.

KAEDEN: After that, you'll go to the sushi takeaway counter.

CHARLOTTE: Will I be preparing boxes of food?

KAEDEN: For today, you'll just be helping the staff.

CHARLOTTE: Yes, of course.

KAEDEN: You'll see lots of flat cardboard boxes at one end of the counter.

Beneath those is where we keep the plastic boxes – we run out of those really quickly, so you should bring more from the storeroom.

CHARLOTTE: Is that my only task on the sushi counter?

KAEDEN: No. You also need to clean the area where they prepare the dishes.

There are cloths and bottles of spray by the sink. Oh, and please make sure you clean that too.

CHARLOTTE: Sure. That's important, isn't it?

KAEDEN: Absolutely. But you mustn't wash up knives.

You have to do some training before you're allowed to touch sharp objects.

CHARLOTTE: What should I do if there are any?

KAEDEN: Ask someone to put them in the dishwasher.

CHARLOTTE: OK, thanks. I don't want to get anything wrong.

KAEDEN: Don't worry. You'll be fine. And I'll be around to help.

CHARLOTTE: Right.

KAEDEN: Finally, the meat and fish counters.

You need to clean the area where staff serve customers, including wiping the weighing scales.

CHARLOTTE: OK. Anything else?

KAEDEN: The fish is laid on ice, but when that starts to melt, you'll need to get more from the cold-room.

CHARLOTTE: I know the staff on the food counters wear a hat. Will that be the same for me?

KAEDEN: You won't be serving customers directly, so no.

But make sure you put on thermal gloves when you take anything out of the cold-room.

The temperature's low enough in there to get frostbite from touching things.

CHARLOTTE: Understood.
