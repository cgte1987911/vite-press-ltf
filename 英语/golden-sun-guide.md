\ Introduction /
 '============'

It's been a while since a game has come out that I've thoroughly enjoyed. 
Golden Sun is a huge game, and when I was playing it, it reminded me of the 
days when I would look forward to SNES RPGs. The game play elements are very 
unique (using psynergy out of battle, and changing classes with the Djinni 
system). The graphics are outstanding, especially in battle, and the music is 
really good too. The only thing that really was disappointing was the 
continuation of the game into Golden Sun: The Lost Age. I felt kinda lost at 
the end, but that feeling is easily remedied by playing the sequel.

The town of Vale has guarded the four Elemental Stars for as long as its stood. 
The Stars themselves had sat hidden within Sol Sanctum, untouched for many 
years. This all changed with the appearance of two strange people calling 
themselves Saturos and Menardi. 

The first time these two showed up was during an eruption of Mt. Aleph, located 
north of Vale. A boy named Issac was out with his friends, trying to help 
people escape the inevitable damage to the town, when Saturos and Menardi 
decided to fight him. Issac had no chance against the two, and soon fell 
unconscious. As if this were not bad enough, Issac's friend Felix is washed 
down a river and is taken for dead.

A few years later, repairs are still being done on the town. Kraden, a scholar 
on the outskirts of town, asks Issac to stop by. Issac, his friend Garet, and 
Jenna (Felix's sister) are on their way over, when they suddenly see Saturos 
and Menardi again, plotting another invasion. There is no fight this time, 
however. Issac and his friends tell Kraden about it, and they decide to head to 
Mount Aleph and enter Sol Sanctum to see what they can do. This is where all 
the trouble starts...

~=============================================================================~

A lot of Golden Sun is like a traditional RPG. You fight monsters out on the 
field and in the dungeons, you get money and items from defeating the monsters, 
and you can use the money to buy better equipment and items for your 
characters. Fighting is turn based, and villagers still let you enter their 
houses and steal anything you find. 

But what would an RPG be without a few unique elements?

========
Psynergy                                                                 [psy1]
========

In Golden Sun, special people called "Adepts" can use the power of psynergy. 
Each character that can use it is affiliated with one of the four elements: 
Earth, Fire, Wind, and Water (or Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Mercury 
respectively). This means that if a character is a Mars adept, he or she can 
use psynergy that is fire based. Like most other RPGs, you can use the type of 
psynergy to your advantage when fighting monsters affiliated with the opposite 
element.

Mars is the opposite of Mercury (Fire vs. Water)
Venus is the opposite of Jupiter (Earth vs. Wind)

Also, using psynergy on an enemy of the same element affiliation will result in 
less damage. All other types of combinations (for example, Earth vs. Fire) will 
result in normal damage. 

There are two ways to gain psynergy in Golden Sun. The most straightforward way 
is to gain levels. The psynergy you learn will depend on what Class you 
character is, but I'll explain that in a sec. The other way to gain psynergy is 
to equip certain items. Usually, these items will be necessary in completing 
the game.

You'll be using a lot of psynergy in battle, but you'll be using it out of 
battle far more often. This is one of the more unique elements of Golden Sun. 
Usually, the psynergy you use out of battle can't be used in battle, and vice 
versa, but there are a few exceptions. 

There are many uses for psynergy out of battle, and they mostly help you get to 
places otherwise impossible to reach. For example, there may be a stone pillar 
on the far side of a pit that you need to jump across, but there is no way of 
physically moving it. You can use your Move psynergy to move it. In the case of 
Move, a giant hand will come out and shoot across the pit, grabbing on to the 
pillar. From here, you, as the player, have the decision of where to move it. 
Psynergy will be used throughout the game to solve puzzles and uncover secrets 
(even by reading the minds of villagers).

All psynergy used drains a character's PP (just like magic and MP). Check out 
the psynergy list for more information.

=====
Djinn                                                                    [djn1]
=====

Djinn are small creatures that got scattered all over the world after the 
eruption of Mt. Aleph. When you find one, they'll either join you immediately, 
or fight you first. They'll usually join you immediately if you solve a complex 
puzzle to get to them, and will usually attack you if they're out in the open. 
Later on in the game, you'll find that they attack no matter how hard it is to 
simply reach them.

Using Djinn wisely is the key to survival in Golden Sun. Unless you're at an 
absurdly high level, you're going to have to rely on the Djinn to pull you 
through each battle. After a Djinni joins you, you can set it to a character. 
This means that this specific character can use the Djinni during a battle. 
Each Djinni has its own special ability that it always uses, whether it's an 
attack Djinni, a healing Djinni, or a Djinni that changes the stats of the 
party or enemy. Each Djinni is also affiliated with a certain element. 

Setting a Djinni to a character raises his or her stats. Having different 
combinations of Djinn equipped to a character can also change his or her class. 
A higher class means a huge boost in stats, and usually different psynergy. By 
unequipping Djinn and lowering the class of a character, you lose the boost in 
stats, and the psynergy, but it you can always get it all back by equipping the 
Djinn again. There's never any pressure about permanent loss.

In the early stages of the game, you'll want to play off the character's 
strengths. This means equipping Djinn to characters of the matching element. 
This causes their psynergy to become more powerful, rather than change to 
something else entirely. Later in the game, when enemies exploit the weaknesses 
of your characters, you'll want to mix the Djinn up between players a bit. This 
balances out your characters a lot more, and raises your chances of survival. 

There's more you can do with Djinn in battle. As I said earlier, a character 
with a Djinni set to him or her can use it in battle, but this means that it 
will no longer be set to that character. Consequently, your stats will drop, 
and possibly your class. Some psynergy may also be lost. You can continue 
summoning Djinn, however, to build up for a very powerful attack. After you've 
used a Djinni in battle, you can summon him back in, which does even more 
damage to the enemy. The more Djinni of the same element used up in a battle, 
the stronger the summon will be. 

For example, Issac, a Venus adept, uses a Venus Djinni in battle, and it is no 
longer set to him. He can now summon it back as just a Djinni and do some 
damage to the enemies. But if he uses another Venus Djinni, he can summon both 
back at the same time in the form of a giant Egyptian creature called Ramses, 
and do a lot more damage. Summoning multiple Djinn back into battle changes the 
appearance of the Djinn. The more you use, the cooler the summoned monster 
looks. Check the summon section for more details.

Summoning Djinn in battle causes them to become fatigued for a few rounds, but 
once they're back on their feet, they'll automatically set themselves back to 
the character they were on before, letting you start the process over again. 

TIPS

-You can set Djinn back onto a character manually in battle if you don't want 
to summon them and wait for them to recover.

-You can unequip all Djinn from a character before a battle, and start off the 
battle with a really strong summon.

-If a Djinni is set to a character, only he or she can use it. If a Djinni is 
ready to be summoned, it goes to a pool where any of the characters can summon 
it.

For more information, look at the summon section, the Djinn section, and the 
class section.

Rare Items                                                               [ritm]
==========

Just a little side tip that I thought I would mention: If you sell a rare item, 
you will be able to buy it back from any shopkeeper anywhere. This means that 
you'll always have access to any item in the game, and you don't have to worry 
about losing a weapon. There is always a way to get it back. 

Items can be obtained from shops, chests, mini-games, and are sometimes dropped 
by monsters. Check the following lists for more information:

~=============================================================================~

Q. How do I transfer my saved data from Golden Sun to Golden Sun: The Lost Age?

   A. First beat the game, and save the clear data when it asks you to. Next, 
      at the title screen, hold left and R and then press Start. Let go of the 
      buttons after the menu has opened, and there should be an option called 
      "Send". Select that option, and then choose your clear data. You can link 
      up to Golden Sun: The Lost Age if you have a second Game Boy and a link 
      cable. If you don't, you'll have to write down a password. Which password 
      you use is up to you, but the best password is the Gold password, as it 
      lets you bring the most stuff to the next game.  


Q. Help! I completed the game, but I don't have all the Djinn or the Orb of 
   Force!

   A. If you still have a save file before defeating the last boss, try to go 
      back and get the Djinn. If you don't have the Orb of Force, get someone 
      else's password.


Q. I can't get back to (town name).

   A. By the end of the game, you'll be able to return to any town, so don't 
      worry about it.


Q. How do I make the ship sail back to Kalay?

   A. You can't. Take the Gondowan Cave back to Kalay (southeast of Tolbi).


Q. What do I do in (name of town)?

   A. Chances are, if you talked to everyone, you'd know where to go next. If 
      not, check the walkthrough for more info.


Q. I just completed (name of place). What do I do now?

   A. Usually, the dirt path on the world map will lead you to your next 
      destination.


Q. How do I get to Crossbone Isle?

   A. One of two ways. The first chance you'll get to access it is when you are 
      trying to select rowers for the ship to Tolbi. If you select a certain 
      combination of rowers, the ship will veer far off course and run aground 
      on Crossbone Isle. The combination is:

         1. The arrogant guy in the green cape on the right side of the room. 
            "Hey! You're not thinking of making me an oarsman, are you?"
         2. The bald guy on the left side of the room. "What? Ohhhh, noooo... 
            Are you going to make me row?"
         3. The chef. "You... You must be joking. You want me to row?"
         4. The old man in the bottom left. "Out of all these people, you're 
            asking a frail old man like me to row?"

      The other way to reach the Isle is to let the giant pink whirlwind in the 
      Suhalla Desert to take you there. You can use this method as much as you 
      like.


Q. Do I need to go to Crossbone Isle or sneak into Lunpa?

   A. No. There are many places and items in the game that you never need to 
      seek out, but it sure does help if you do. Sneaking into Lunpa ties a 
      loose end in the plot, gets you a Djinni, and lets you access many items. 
      Completing Crossbone Isle gets you some of the strongest items in the 
      entire game.


Q. What's the "K-Sword" and how do I get it?
   
   A. Commonly called the "K-Sword" for short, the Kikuichimonji is a weapon 
      that can only be obtained by defeating a certain enemy at the end of the 
      game. The chances that you'll receive the weapon after a battle is slim, 
      but there is a foolproof way of getting the sword by manipulating the 
      Random Number Generator built into the game. I'll explain how to get the 
      sword itself, but if you want more information, please check the specific 
      FAQs at GameFAQs.

      To start, you need to be in the first room of the Venus lighthouse 
      (Psynergy Stone, an engraving of a tree, two staircases, and a door):

      1. Make sure that all of your Djinn are equipped on their default 
      characters.

      2. Make sure Garet's agility is above 150. If it isn't, give him someone  
      else's Quick Boots. If that doesn't work, level up until he's ready. Also 
      make sure that MIA GOES BEFORE GARET, or else it won't work. You may have 
      to give both characters Quick Boots.

      3. Save your game in this room (the three doors and the Psynergy Stone).

      4. Reset.

      Okay, now you're all set. Reload your game and walk around until you get 
      into a battle. It should be with a Fenrir and an Ice Gargoyle.

      For the first round (aiming the big arrows at the Fenrir):
      Clay Spire with Issac
      Flare Wall with Garet
      Cast Tornado with Ivan
      Ice Horn with Mia
      (NOTE: These psynergies are interchangeable with other spells that are 
      similar. If you find that they are too weak or too strong, change the 
      psynergy.)

      For round two:
      Defend with Issac
      Unleash Torch with Garet at the Fenrir
      (the Fenrir should die after the attack; again, Garet's agility should be 
      above 150, or the Fenrir will attack before Garet does, and you won't get 
      the sword.)
      Defend with Ivan
      Cast Wish with Mia

      For round three:
      Unleash Bane with Issac to kill the Ice Gargoyle
      Defend with everyone else

      This should get you the Kikuichimonji, and a Potion to boot. This always 
      works, I guarantee (that is, if you follow what I say EXACTLY).


Q. What is the best team with the best equipment?

   A. Issac                         Garet
      -----                         -----

      Gaia Blade                    Muramasa
      Warrior's Helm                Thunder Crown
      Mirrored Shield               War Gloves
      Asura's Armor                 Demon Mail
      Hyper Boots                   Quick Boots
      War Ring                      Cleric's Ring
      Mythril Shirt                 Running Shirt


      Ivan                          Mia
      ----                          ---

      Kikuichimonji                 Blessed Mace
      Jeweled Crown                 Mythril Circlet
      Aura Gloves                   Spirit Armlet
      Storm Gear                    Oracle's Robe
      Hyper Boots                   Quick Boots
      War Ring                      War Ring
      Mythril Shirt                 Mythril Shirt


      There are some who would say that the Swift Sword is better for Ivan at 
      higher levels, and there are some that would say that the Demon's Axe is 
      better for Garet when he's a different class. These were just my 
      suggestions. Do whatever you see fit.

      As for classes, one of the best combinations is the following:

      Issac with one Venus Djinni and six Jupiter Djinni (Conjurer).
      Garet with one Mars Djinni and six Venus Djinni (Berserker).
      Ivan with one Jupiter Djinni and six Mercury Djinni (Sage).
      Mia with one Mercury Djinni and six Mars Djinni (Water Monk).

      Of course, you should arrange them so that they suit your playing style.

A little trick before you start the game: When it asks you to name Issac, hit 
the select button a bunch of times until you hear a chime. Now you can name all 
your characters.

 ---------------

As the game starts out, we find Issac being rushed downstairs by his mother. 
She uses psynergy almost right away as an example of its use during the game. 
As she's taking you downstairs, you're asked if you have everything you need. 
Regardless of what you say, you are rushed downstairs. Once there, your mother 
asks you to wait in the plaza to the south. If you try, a boulder falls down 
and blocks any further progress. An attempt to use the other staircase also 
proves futile, as another boulder falls and blocks your path.

If you head north, you'll find your friend Garet trying to lug all of his 
belongings out of the town. Garet decides to just leave his stuff and head off 
with Issac to the plaza. Head to the north and cross the bridge to the left. At 
this point the boulder will start to fall, and the townsfolk will use their 
psynergy to hold it up. They can't last for long, but in reality, you have all 
the time in the world to do what you want. Head down the stairs to the south 
and enter the new area to the left.

Once you pass the guy lying on the ground and start to loop around to the east 
again, you'll be attacked by a Vermin. For now, all you can do is attack, so 
keep doing that until you win the battle. This goes for any other battles you 
might fight from here on out. Head right to enter the main part of town again.

Head south down the two staircases until you witness a disturbing scene. 
Jenna's sister Felix has been washed downstream by the torrent, and is hanging 
on for dear life. Your mother used the last of her psynergy getting your tunic 
for you (see what laziness gets you?), so you, Jenna, and Garet have to go look 
for other townsfolk with psynergy. Head south and then east into a new part of 
town.

Skip all the houses, as there are no people in them or valuables to loot. In 
the south part of town, you'll find the plaza. One of the men there uses the 
psynergy stone to refill his PP. Now head all the way back to save Felix.

Needless to say, things don't go well. Talk to everyone and then head back to 
the plaza. Two strangers appear, and they seem to be the ones responsible for 
the storm. Unfortunately, they notice Issac and Garet, and decide that they 
know too much. The battle that ensues is not fair in the least, and Issac and 
Garet soon fall unconscious.

 -------------------------------

We learn that in the past three years, much of Vale is rebuilt, and the 
villagers are more accepting of the deaths of their friends and family. Issac 
and Garet have also been training their psynergy. Jenna reminds Issac and Garet 
that they should be at Kraden's house learning about psynergy. 

Before you do that, you should explore the town and steal things from people's 
houses. You can start with the house right next to Issac's. A jar in here 
contains 6 COINS. Head south from here. You'll come across two more houses. The 
northernmost one has an ANTIDOTE in it. Felix's house across the river is still 
in ruins. Head east to the plaza. The northernmost house here has 3 COINS. The 
bottom right house in this cluster of four contains a SMOKE BOMB. Head south to 
reach the plaza itself. The house to the left of the Weapon and Armor shop has 
an HERB, and there is a barrel on the second floor of the Inn that contains 1 
COIN. 

While you're in the area, take the time to outfit your party. For Issac and 
Garet, get Travel Vests, Wooden Shields, and Leather Caps. Don't worry about 
equipping Jenna, as she'll be leaving you shortly. You should also take the 
time to free up inventory space by giving one character all the Herbs.

Okay, remember the area that you had your first battle with the Vermin? Head 
back there now (left of Issac's house). You have to enter the area from the 
north, because a group of puppies are... well, playing in front of the south 
entrance. As you enter, the two strangers who beat you up three years ago 
(Saturos and Menardi) appear again. This time, they let you go without a fight. 
As you talk to Kraden, he suggests a trip to Mt. Aleph to confirm that Saturos 
and Menardi were actually up there. Get the ELIXIR from the jar to the left of 
Kraden's house before you go. There are also 5 COINS in a jar in Kraden's 
house.

Head back to the east into the area with Issac's house. If you try to go north, 
and enter Mt. Aleph, a man there will stop you. After he's done reprimanding 
you, wait until he's behind the building and run for it.

You'll be facing a lot of enemies in Sol Sanctum, so make sure you have at 
least a few Herbs. Remember, you have psynergy now, so make good use of it.

After a few words from Kraden in the first room, head north to the next room.


Puzzle #1 - Stepping stones

Most of this room is submerged in water, so you'll have to use the stones 
sticking out to cross to the other side. Use the chart from 0-9 to find your 
way across.


Exit that room at the north end and follow the hallway all the way to another 
room with stepping stones.


Puzzle #2 - More stepping stones

There are three paths on the far side of the water. You'll want to visit all of 
them. Follow these three charts to reach each hallway.

Puzzle #3 - Where's the door?

There seems to be no visible exit in this room, but that's only because it's 
covered by a statue. Whenever you see a statue or a stone pillar surrounded by 
tiny white dots, it means you can move it. There are two such statues in this 
room. The one on the left leads to an empty room, so push aside the one on the 
right and head on up the stairs.


Now you're in a maze-like section. Use the map to find your way through:

       |_________________|  

A - Entrance
B - Exit
# - Chest

Don't forget to stop and grab the chest, which contains another SMALL JEWEL.


Puzzle #4 - I can't reach the statue!

Once you're out of the maze, you're faced with another puzzle. You can move the 
statues in this room, but there's no way of physically pushing them. The 
solution? Psynergy. Set the Move psynergy to either L or R as a shortcut from 
the psynergy menu, and then use it on the statues. The statue on the far left 
is concealing a Minotaur head that you need to place the Small Jewel in. 
There's a door to behind the statue to the right, but it doesn't lead anywhere. 
The exit you just opened is behind the statue to the far right.


Another maze, but not bad enough that you'll need a map. Head right and take 
the first path up. At the fork, go left for a chest with an HERB. Back at the 
fork, head right and take the first path up to enter the next area.


Puzzle #5 - Sun and moon

Before you attempt this puzzle, you should definitely give any items that Jenna 
has to Issac or Garet. In fact, unequip her entirely, and give those items to 
another party member to sell later. You should be particularly interested in 
keeping any Game Tickets you may have already gotten.

After exploring the two rooms, Kraden asks you to go upstairs while he stares 
at the wall. As soon as you're at the top of the stairs, head down and enter 
the room here. Inside, you'll find a psynergy stone. When you find one, you're 
in luck because they restore the entire party's PP. This also means that you 
can use Cure on everyone to bring them back to full health and then use the 
Psynergy Stone to restore the lost PP. Once a stone is used, it doesn't 
reappear until you exit the area entirely.

Once you're done healing and saving, head back out, and head north. The statues 
here can be moved onto the platforms, but it causes a trap and a long cut 
scene. You'll have to activate the other statues to the left. Moving the two 
statues in the upper left and upper right onto their respective platforms 
causes a hole to open up in the floor. Jump across to the island from the 
south, and use Move to drop the big statue into the hole.

Now that the trap has been disabled, you can move the statues to the right onto 
their platforms. The island in the middle can be used to hop from front to 
back. When you go back downstairs, you'll find Kraden flipping out about the 
changes that you've made. It is pretty cool actually. When you inspect the wall 
in the room to the left, a portal opens, and everyone jumps in.


Puzzle #6 - Collecting the elemental stars

Kraden gets even more excited when he discovers the elemental stones. He gives 
you four MYTHRIL BAGS and instructs you to collect all four stars. The catch 
is, some of the stone pillars are in the water, and you have to collect the 
Stars in a certain order. Start by jumping on the stones in the upper right, 
next to the portal. Follow these as they loop around to the southeast where you 
get the VENUS STAR.

Use the newly raised stones to head north to the MERCURY STAR in the northeast 
corner. Head back to the main platform.

The stones to the south lead to the JUPITER STAR in the southwest. After taking 
this Star, some shocking events unfold, and you are asked to retrieve the last 
Star. 

To get the MARS STAR, head all the way back to the main platform and use the 
stones in the upper right corner again. These lead all the way to the 
northwest, and to the Mars Star. Grab that, and observe the dramatic outcome of 
your actions.


Now you have to run all the way back out to the town, but that's no big deal, 
right? I trust that you remember the way, but if you don't just follow my 
instructions in reverse (specifically the stepping stone charts). Or um... you 
could also just use the Retreat psynergy. That's easier, and there are no 
enemies on the way back, so you won't be missing anything.

Back in town, everyone is relieved to hear that the eruption won't touch Vale. 
The townsfolk discuss their next plan of action. They plan on an adventure, and 
it involves - Surprise! - Issac and Garet. They plan on kicking them out of 
town (in the most friendly way possible, of course) the very next day.

During the farewell, you receive an HERB and the CATCH BEADS. Equip them to 
learn the psynergy Catch. You can equip them on any party member you want.

As soon as you step outside Vale into the world, you find one of the Djinn that 
have been mentioned a couple of times. Flint will give you a brief tutorial 
about Djinn, but for more in depth tips, read the Djinn section under Game 
Basics. You should probably set Flint to Issac for now.

Before you progress any further, it's probably a good idea to fight enemies 
until you have enough Coins to buy a Long Sword for Issac and Garet (400 
Coins). Remember to sell Jenna's equipment if you took it. Don't use the Inn if 
you need to heal either. Use Issac's Cure psynergy, and then hop across to the 
island in the plaza to restore his PP. While you're in town, stop by the tree 
at the top of the long steps that are above Felix's old house. You can get the 
NUT hanging from the tree using your newfound Catch ability. You should be 
around level 3 or 4 after saving up for the weapons.

When you try to enter Vault (follow the dirt path to get there) you'll witness 
a group of Caravans heading out to Kalay. The bridge they need to use is out, 
the town they just came from contains thieves, and the mountain is still 
erupting, so they seek refuge in a town called Lunpa. It's a bad decision on 
their part, but ignore it for now. You can actually go north to Lunpa to grab 
the NUT hanging on the tree, if you really want it.

 -------------------------------

You're going to be raiding every town you come to for items, so you might as 
well get used to it. The house straight ahead of you when you enter the town 
contains 7 COINS in a jar on the right side. The door in the cliff face to the 
north leads to the item shop. There is a SLEEP BOMB in the barrel on the right 
side of the room. The house left of the one that you found the Coins in 
contains 4 COINS in the barrel next to the bed. The house to the left of that 
one contains a MINT in a crate below the bed, and the crate next to the house 
to the north contains a NUT. You should probably think about using the Mint on 
Garet to boost his Agility, but save it for later if you feel the need.

Now that you're done looting the town, you should talk to people to learn more 
about the theft that occurred. When you're ready, enter the Mayor's house (the 
northwestern one) and talk to the boy standing near the back.

Ivan, like Issac and Garet, is an adept. He also happens to be a Jupiter adept, 
and that's a welcome addition to your party. His Mind Read psynergy will come 
in handy throughout the game. For now, you agree to help him retrieve the 
stolen rod. This is the first big example of how his Mind Read will come in 
handy. Ivan comes equipped with decent armor, but you should consider picking 
him up a Short Sword at the Weapon Shop.

If you want clues as to the whereabouts of the Rod, talk to people around town 
using Mind Read (you'll have to set it to L or R). Or, if you don't feel like 
doing that, just go to the second floor of the Inn, and the two guys there will 
start running away. Chasing after them proves futile, but if you try to leave, 
your team will come up with a plan to corner the two shady characters.

After you corner them, Ivan learns that the thieves have hidden all their loot 
in the Inn somewhere. If you head outside, the woman there shaking her head 
will tell you that the worker that was supposed to be fixing the roof is 
slacking. This is your chance to climb up the ladder and inspect the roof. The 
hole leads to the attic of the Inn, and you can use Move to move the giant 
crate out of the way. This reveals an entrance to a secret room where the 
thieves have hidden all the valuables.

As you cut away the ropes from the worker, and come to the conclusion that 
you've found all the stolen stuff, the three thieves appear and decide to 
attack.

Boss Fight - Thief X2, Bandit
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recommended level: 4           
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The easiest way to win this battle is to constantly summon and use Flint, and 
use psynergy attacks that target everyone.

Have Issac use Earthquake and Cure when he's not summoning, have Garet use 
Flare, and have Ivan use Ray.

After the battle, you get a BANDIT'S SWORD.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the battle, the thieves are captured, and you get back Ivan's SHAMAN'S 
ROD. Ivan will leave you for a bit, but you'll see him again soon. Remember to 
visit the Mayor for some WATER OF LIFE. Your Bandit's Sword doesn't appear to 
be too powerful, but if you save it, you can equip it on Ivan when he comes 
back. For now, fight monsters outside the town until you have enough Coins to 
buy two Battle Axes (for Issac and Garet).

If you've been observant, you may have noticed the bell tower in the upper 
right corner of town. If you ring the bell, you'll scare a Djinni out of 
hiding. Unfortunately, you can't get it yet, but rest assured I'd let you know 
when it's time.

When you leave the town, head east across the bridge, skip the first bridge 
leading north, and continue northeast until you reach a cave.

Head north and jump the river using the stump. Push the stone pillar out of the 
way, climb up the ladder, and use Move on the other stone pillar so you can 
cross the gap. When you try to use Move on the stump to the left, you realize 
that the ivy is holding it down. Ivan comes to the rescue and uses Whirlwind to 
clear all the ivy away. Now you can easily move the stump, and continue onward.

Before you do that, however, head all the way back to Vale and check behind the 
Weapon shop. The ivy here can be cleared away with Whirlwind, and it reveals a 
cave with a chest containing POWER BREAD. I suggest that you use this on Ivan 
to boost his HP, since it's pretty low right now.

Okay, now go back to Goma Cave, and push that stump out of the way. Behind the 
stump is more ivy that you can blow away with Whirlwind. This reveals the 
entrance to the cave proper.

The cave layout is pretty simple. Head north to cross the stream, and then loop 
back around to the south to find a stairway leading up. Head all the way to the 
right side of this area. You'll find a Djinni on a cliff that you can't get 
quite yet. Set the stone in between the two ledges so that you'll be able to 
make it over to the Djinni later.

Back to the west and a bit south is a big lake type thing. Jump over the lake 
at the skinny section, and head down the stairs to the right. In this new area, 
make your way to the upper left, and take these stairs. Push the pillar out of 
your way with move, and jump across. The stump to the south acts as a stepping-
stone in the lake below. Go back up and push the pillar back into its original 
position, and jump to the ledge to the right. The chest here contains a LUCKY 
MEDAL. These will be used much later in the game.

Head back down the stairs you came up, and use the new stepping-stone to reach 
another staircase. Since you pushed the stone pillar into place, you'll be able 
to reach the Mars Djinni Forge sitting on the ledge. You might want to save 
before approaching it, because apparently, just reaching him isn't enough. 
You'll have to fight him! Use Flint with Issac, and Ray with Ivan. Stick to 
regular attacks with Garet, as his psynergy isn't that strong against the fire-
based creature. If the Djinni runs, you'll have to leave the area and come back 
to make him reappear. After it's defeated, Forge joins you. It's a good idea to 
set it to Garet.

Jump back across and head up the steps. By pushing the stump out of the way 
here, you're actually making a shortcut back to the beginning of the cave. This 
way, if you ever want to go through the cave again, it'll be a snap. Jump 
across and follow the path north until you exit the cave.

 -------------------------------

When you first enter the town, you'll notice a tree that looks almost like a 
man. Use mind read on it to find that it actually is a man. You can't do 
anything about it yet though, so commence with the raiding of the town.

The house in front of you and a bit to the left contains an ANTIDOTE in the 
barrel in the bottom left corner. Outside, check the jar to the left to get 5 
COINS. The house to the left of this one has a SLEEP BOMB under the bed. Exit 
this house and go north to the next one. A barrel in the back of the room 
contains a HARD NUT. You can use this on Ivan if you want, but I would save it 
for the fourth party member, Mia. To the east, past the statue and the well, is 
a set of stairs. Check the jar at the top for an HERB.

The shops in Bilibin are anything but cheap. You'll probably only have about 
500 Coins after your trek through the cave, so don't worry about purchasing 
everything right away. If anything, buy Leather Armor for Issac and Garet.

Moving the suspicious looking statue in the middle of town reveals a secret 
hole that you can climb down. There is a new Jupiter Djinni to the right, but 
you can't reach it because of the statue blocking the way. Head back out of the 
hole, and climb up the stairs to the right. You can walk on the top of the logs 
that surround the town, and doing so takes you all the way to the left side, 
where you can use Whirlwind on the ivy to reveal a cave entrance. From here, 
you can move the statue aside and collect Gust, the Jupiter Djinni. You should 
set him to Ivan for now.

Talk to the townspeople to learn that a curse has fallen on the town due to the 
Lord's cutting of the trees in Kolima Forest. Go north to a new area to find 
McCoy's Palace. Before you enter, use Catch to grab the NUT off the tree to the 
left, and talk to Lady McCoy. She seems to not care a bit about the clearing of 
the forest for her own palace. Talk to the guards in front of the main palace, 
and tell them you want to enter. Follow them inside when they open the door.

Head left when you enter. Go up the stairs in the bottom left corner, and 
follow them up until you reach a dead end with a barrel. It contains a SMOKE 
BOMB. Head back down to the main floor, and head to the right until you see to 
women in front of a fireplace. The barrel on the right contains an ELIXIR. Once 
you're done looting, head straight through the palace to reach Lord McCoy. He 
seems like an okay guy, but he still won't let you go through the barricade... 
you are "wee children" after all. On the way out, the guard lets it slip that 
you may not need a key to get through the barricade. 

BILIBIN BARRICADE
-----------------

Follow the dirt path southeast of Bilibin to reach the barricade. At first, it 
seems that you really can't get through, but if you use Move on the crate to 
the left, you'll be able to get through. Ignore the three trees stacked on each 
other (?) and continue through.

-No shops open yet-

Heading east from the barricade will bring you to Kolima forest and the town of 
Kolima. When you enter the town (further east than the forest), a small cut 
scene will play, showing what exactly is happening to turn the villagers into 
trees. Tret, the master of the woods, is understandably pissed about the 
woodcutting, and has accordingly turned people into trees. It's your job to 
stop this from happening any more. 

Now, it's time to grab whatever you can from the town. A jar on the third floor 
of the Inn contains a LUCKY MEDAL. On the third floor of the Weapon Shop to the 
east, you'll find 7 COINS in a barrel. East of the Weapon Shop, in a cluster of 
jars, you'll find an APPLE, and west of the house below the Weapon Shop is a 
jar with an HERB in it. You should use the Apple on Issac.

The bottom right house with the fenced in area contains a Venus Djinni. If you 
enter the house from the front, you might be surprised at the seemingly small 
interior. Don't know what to do? Walk around back and enter a new area of the 
house through a hidden door. Climb down the ladder and fight your way through a 
small cave section until you reach Granite, the Venus Djinni. Before you head 
through the cave, take off all of Issac's Venus Djinn so that you can use a 
cool new summons on the way back.

Here's a little secret that you aren't supposed to figure out for a while: Head 
out of town and continue west, not crossing any bridges on the way. You'll come 
to a peninsula type area with a forest covering most of it. Search the ground 
in the middle to pick up a pair of TURTLE BOOTS. They raise your Defense, but 
at a great cost to your Agility. Head back to Bilibin and sell them for a tidy 
profit. 

Now is when you should start thinking about getting most of the best equipment 
sold here. For Issac, buy the Broad Sword, Bronze Shield, and Wooden Cap. Buy 
the same equipment for Garet as well. For Ivan, pick up the Witch's Wand, a 
Travel Robe, Leather Gloves, and a Wooden Cap. That's a lot of cash to save 
up... you'll be best off fighting for money in the cave that leads to the 
Djinni in Kolima. If you feel that the Broad Swords are much too expensive for 
now, you can hold off on those until later.

Located northwest of Kolima, Kolima Forest is where the evil tree Tret lurks, 
casting curses on Kolima and Bilibin. You should have good equipment and be at 
least level 8 before you enter.

Fallen trees block a lot of the forest that you need to push out of your way. 
The first area isn't that much of a puzzle. You should be able to make it to 
the upper left corner without too much trouble.

In the next area, ignore the log in front of you and head to the left. Push the 
horizontal log down to clear the way north, and enter the new area.

Puzzle #1 - Log Moving

Now things get a little bit tougher. This is what the logs look like in this 
area:



                      _
 _______             | |
|_______|            | |

                      1
     _______
    |_______|
        3

A. Push log #1 to the left to reach log #2.
B. Push log #2 down.
C. Push log #1 back to the right to reach log #3.
D. Push log #3 down.
E. Loop all the way around to the right side of log #1, and push it 
   into the water.

Now head up the steps into the next area.

Puzzle #2 - Log Moving and Lake Draining

This puzzle is the toughest one in the forest. You have to drain the lake, move 
the logs into a desired position, and then fill the lake up again to reach your 
destination. You can either take the path to the chest, or take the path to the 
exit. If you leave the area, you can reset the puzzle, so you will be able to 
reach both areas. Here's how to get to the chest:

First drain the lake by pulling the lever, and then go down into the lakebed.

      4

A. Push both log #2 and #3 up.
B. Push log #1 to the right.
C. Push log #2 down.
D. Push log #4 to the right.
E. Push log #3 down.
F. Push log #4 back to the left.

Refill the lake, and that'll let you reach the FUR COAT. Now exit the area to 
reset the puzzle. Ivan's a good idea for the Fur Coat.

To reach the exit, simply move log #1 to the left.

In the new area, you'll find Laurel and Tret. They don't really have much to 
say, so you'll have to heal the tree from the inside (*cough*DekuTree*cough*).

 ------------------

Tret Tree is six levels high, and in order to make it to the first floor, 
you'll have to make it all the way to the top first and break through a spider 
web (*cough*DekuTreeagainIsmellalawsuit*cough*).

Make your way to the back of the second floor (the one you start out on) and 
climb the vine to the third floor. The spider webs here have leaves on them, 
and you can step on the full leaves without worries. If you step on an already 
crumbled one, you'll fall through the web and have to start from the floor 
below. Here on the third floor, head down all the way, and use the three leaves 
closest to the bottom to jump across the web. Exit onto the exterior of the 
tree to the right.

The branches of the tree are strange in that you can't see very far in front of 
you because of the leaves. Just go right on the branch until you reach the 
vine. Climb up and head back to the left to enter the fourth floor. You can 
loop around and go for the Psynergy Stone, but you should only do it if you're 
really really low on health and/or PP. If you do get the stone, you'll have to 
jump back across the web, but you'll fall through in doing so, and will have to 
come all the way back up. The same goes for the chest in this area, though it's 
worth it to grab the chest, because it contains a HEALING RING. It's pretty 
useful at this point in the game. Ivan is a good choice for the ring for now. 
Once you're done getting things, head up the vine in the back of the area (jump 
across the leaf that you used to get the ring).

Take the southern exit from the fifth floor, and start heading up the branches. 
You'll end up coming to another door into the tree, but if you backtrack a few 
steps, and walk up the branch that leads up, you'll come across a Djinni. 
You'll have to fight this Djinni before it joins you. After you've got him, 
slap him on Ivan and enter the door to the left. You'll find a NUT in a chest 
here. Break through the web here to easily get back to the fifth floor. 

This time take the exit to the west. You'll eventually end up on the left side 
of the sixth floor. This is what the leaves look like:

   L   B   L

   B   L = L
       |
   L - L   B   L

L - regular leaf
B - broken leaf

Jump on the leaf in the bottom left corner, jump one to the right, one up, one 
right, and then back to the left. You'll fall through the entire trunk down to 
the first floor. Head north and speak to Tret's... other face to start a 
battle.

Boss Fight - Tret 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recommended level: 9           
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using high level summons like Atalanta and Ramses are a sure fire way to bring 
down the tree. Garet's fire based Psynergy like Volcano is also very effective 
against Tret. Using Granite, Forge, and Breeze is a good idea as well. Status 
changes in the party during tough boss battles is often overlooked, but it's a 
very effective tactic.

You receive a POTION for winning this battle.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Killing Tret turns out to be the wrong course of action. It seems that physical 
harm does not, in fact, heal the tree. It causes him to slowly die. The good 
news is that he's back to his senses, and if you bring him some healing water 
from the Mercury Lighthouse, he'll turn people back.

BILIBIN
-------

Head all the way back to Bilibin and rest at the Inn. While you're stopped 
here, you might as well buy those two Broad Swords if you haven't already (and 
sell any extra equipment you don't need). Once you're done shopping, head north 
from Bilibin, cross a bridge, and head in a westerly direction until you reach 
Bilibin Cave.

| Elven Rapier |
| Vial         |

When you first enter the area, you'll come across a small sprout growing near 
the cliff face. Set one of your Venus Djinn to Garet to teach him the Growth 
psynergy. Using Growth on the plant will cause it to become climbable ivy. Head 
up, jump the river, and then slide down the notch in the cliff face. This lets 
you access the alternate entrance to the cave. Once inside, head to the north, 
take the ELVEN RAPIER out of the chest, and jump down the notch in the ledge. I 
suggest that you equip the Elven Rapier on Issac.

After that, head left and up. At the fork, take a right (up is a dead end) and 
head through the door. Although it looks like you can do a lot in this room, 
there really isn't much you can do (yet). Just head to the right until you 
reach two torches with the white dots around them. Push one next to the ice 
pillar, and you can access the chest behind it that contains a VIAL. Head back 
south to exit the cave. The town of Imil lies to the northwest.

 -------------------------------

The town of Imil seems to be under a sick spell, and only the healing water of 
the Mercury Lighthouse can heal them completely. The item shop is open, but the 
weapon and armor dealers are both sick.

It's raiding time! The house right in front of you as you enter contains an 
EMPTY BOTTLE, which you'll need shortly. Check the stove at the Inn for a LUCKY 
PEPPER. Use this on Ivan, as you'll be using physical attacks with him later in 
the game. (Luck raises your chance of dealing a critical hit). A barrel behind 
the counter at the Weapon Shop contains a SLEEP BOMB. Cross the bridge to the 
left and check the jar next to the house for 9 COINS. The upper left gravestone 
to the south contains a LUCKY MEDAL. Stealing from a gravestone... is that 
going too far...? No. Just do it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, now for some ice sliding.

C - Chest with the Vial
# - Stones
S - Snowman

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a chest and a Djinni that you can get by sliding on the ice. The catch 
is that you can't move freely. Once you step onto the ice, you slide in that 
direction until you hit something. 

To get the chest: 

A. Slide across the ice from the entrance above the gravestones. 
B. When you hit the wall, skate up to stone 2.
C. Left to stone 1.
D. Up to stone 4.
E. Left to the wall.
F. Up to stone 6.
G. Right to stone 5.
H. Up to stone 7.
I. Left to stone 6.
J. Down to stone 1.
K. Left to the wall.
L. Up to stone 3.
M. Right to the ladder, and the chest with a VIAL.

To the cave:

A. Use Move on the snowman to get it on the ice.
B. Slide across the ice from the entrance above the gravestones. 
C. When you hit the wall, skate up to stone 2.
D. Left to stone 1.
E. Up to stone 4.
F. Left to the wall.
G. Up to stone 6.
H. Right to stone 5.
I. Up to stone 7.
J. Left to stone 6.
K. Up to stone 8.
L. Right to snowman.
M. Up to cave.

Inside, you'll meet the Mars Djinn, Fever. It joins without a fight, and is a 
good addition for Garet.

Now, head to the left side of town, and talk to the girl in the sanctum. She 
tells you that Mia is around. Head back to the house at the entrance of town, 
and enter. This time, Mia will be there, and she'll reveal her powers as an 
Adept. She's a Mercury adept, and - surprise! - she's about to join your team. 
Unfortunately... she doesn't quite yet. You'll have to chase her to the 
northeast.

| Sleet (Mercury) |
 -----------------

Mercury Lighthouse is the first real major destination in your quest, and will 
feature the trickiest puzzles yet. At the entrance, push aside the statue for 
Mia, and follow her inside. The monster here is blocking her path, so kill it 
to get rid of it. Continue following Mia. There are two doors in the next room, 
but they essentially lead to the same place, so it doesn't matter which one you 
take. Head straight through and go up the steps. Helping Mia one more time by 
pulling the statue into the pit will make her trust you enough to finally join 
you. Mia comes equipped with Fizz, a healing Djinni (very useful!!). Head 
through the room full of waterfalls to a room full of pipes.

Puzzle #1 - Pipe Connecting

This puzzle really isn't as complicated as it looks at first. Push the pipe to 
the right to finish the connection, and follow the path (there's only one way 
you can go for now). You'll end up on the other side of the pipe you just 
pushed. Push it back to where it was before, breaking the connection. This 
allows you to travel different paths, now that there are no water jets to push 
you around. First, head for the chest on the right side of the room, which 
contains a PSY CRYSTAL. Then make your way to the bottom left corner to reach 
the exit.

In the next room, jump across to the ladder, but don't climb down. Instead, 
walk along ledge that runs along the southern perimeter of the room until you 
reach a statue. Move it all the way over to the button on the floor to open the 
door. Jump down the hole in the next room.

You'll land in front of a giant statue. Jump across to the statue's hands and 
use Ply (set it as a shortcut, or else it won't work). Now when you step on the 
glowing tile (and any others like it from now on) you'll be able to walk a 
limited number of paces on the water. If you go over 3 hops, you'll fall in the 
water and start out from the platform that you originally started jumping from. 
There is no penalty to falling in the water, so don't worry if you get stuck 
and have to jump in.

Head north through either door. In this room, you can't get to the glowing 
block on the left side yet, but you can use the one on the right side to reach 
a new door. You'll emerge out of a waterfall into a room with a single chest. 
If you try to open it, you'll find that it's actually an enemy called a Mimic. 
The battle is tough, as the Mimic has powerful attacks and a lot of HP. If you 
keep the pressure on, and make good use of Fizz, you're sure to win. You'll 
receive a WATER OF LIFE after the battle, as well as a good amount of 
experience points and Coins.

Before you head back through the waterfall, check the waterfall on the right 
for another hidden door. Check the chest in the back of the room for some 
PSYNERGY ARMOR. Only Issac and Garet can equip it, and since Garet probably has 
the lowest Defense, he's a good candidate for the armor. Speaking of Defense, 
use that Hard Nut on Mia if you still have it. Now head all the way back to the 
room behind the statue, and take the door to the north.

Puzzle #2 - Walking on Water

Many of the tiles in this room have lit up now. Your destination is the exit to 
the left, but you can't go directly there due to the dud tiles that cancel out 
your water-walking-on abilities. Here's a big 'ol chart of the room:

To the chest with a SLEEP BOMB:
 _____________________________
|   _________  |         # |__|
|  |         | | # #          |
|  |        _|_|         #    |

|___#        __|__   2-----3  |
|   |_______|_   _|___________| 
 | |          | |  

You'll have to go back to the beginning again due to some dud tiles.

To the exit:

 _____________________________
|   _________  |   .-----6-|__|
|  |         | |-8-7       |  |
|  |        _|_|         # |  |

|_|_#        __|__   2-----3  |
|   |_______|_   _|___________| 
 | |          | |  

Yay. This takes you to the left side of the room behind the statue. Head 
through the door, and then through the waterfall in the middle.

Puzzle #3 - Filling the Pool

You won't get very far in the next room unless you fill it up with water. To 
start, head to the room in the north. Inside, you'll find another pipe puzzle. 
This really is almost too simple to be worthy of one of my puzzle sections, but 
I thought I'd include it. Push the upper most pipe into position, then the 
lower horizontal pipe, and finally the third vertical pipe. This fills up the 
previous room with water, and now you can hop across to the stairs.

Head up a couple flights of stairs until you reach a button. There's nothing 
you can do about it at the moment, as you need to hold the button down to keep 
the door open. Just head up the next set of steps.

Puzzle #4 - Dropping the Statue

This was a little bit harder than puzzle #3, so I had to give it a section, in 
all fairness. Head left and up to the stairway at the north. Loop around the 
right side of the movable vertical pipe (it's a different color). Push it once, 
and it will push the statue a bit with a different water stream. Push the 
horizontal pipe down while you're here, and then loop around to the left side 
of the vertical one. Pushing it to the right makes moves the statue again. Now 
push it back to the left, and push the horizontal pipe down. Pushing it back to 
the right again will finally push the statue down the hole. Go back downstairs 
and push the statue onto the button to open the door.

In this new room, move the third statue from the left to side to open a room 
with a NUT. Head back into the previous room and continue on to the statue on 
the far right side of the room. Move it aside, and enter the other side of the 
same room. Pushing the pipe into place pushes the entire wall out of the way 
and reveals a door.

The only waterfall in this room that contains anything is the fourth one from 
the right. Enter it to find Sleet, the Mercury Djinni. Unfortunately, you'll 
have to fight it before it joins you. Head out of the room and continue to the 
left. Continue through various rooms, and enter the last room in the next 
waterfall hallway. When you reach a dead end, use Ply on the statue, and ride 
the waterfall to the top of the lighthouse. Pick up the Psynergy Stone, and get 
ready for a battle!

Boss Fight - Saturos 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------      
Recommended level: 12           
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Granite, Breeze, and Forge are a good idea for the start of the battle. Use 
plenty of Djinni attacks, and water based psynergy against Saturos. The level 
two summons (Atalanta, Ramses, Nereid, and Kirin) all do massive damage as well.
Remember to heal with Issac, Mia, and Fizz often. Saturos tends to use Fireball 
a lot, and this does a lot of damage... it'll be hard to heal everyone quick 
enough, so your best bet really is to hit hard and fast, hoping he falls before 
you do. 

You get a PSY CRYSTAL for winning the battle.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Head to the left after the battle and take the elevator down. The fountain has 
filled up, and the town of Imil has healed. Remember that you need to get some 
HERMES' WATER in your Empty Bottle before you leave (you didn't forget about 
Tret and Kolima did you?).

Now head all the way through Bilibin Cave, to Bilibin, and then to the 
barricade.

BILIBIN BARRICADE
-----------------

When you enter the barricade, you'll notice that the tree people aren't stacked 
on top of each other anymore. In fact, one of them is in danger of being washed 
down the river. For now, hop into the shallow water and use Move to bring the 
tree-person to safety.

KOLIMA FOREST

Head all the way to visit Tret, who just happens to still be alive. After 
giving him the Hermes' Water, he lifts the curse and gives you some advice. 
When that's over, head to Kolima.

especially if you're low on funds. Now head back through the barricade.

When you enter Lord McCoy's manor, he thanks you and offers you a choice of 
four chests. The items are, from left to right: a Vial, a Potion, a Psy 
Crystal, and a Water of Life. The Water of Life is the most useful item of the 
four.

Now head all the way back to Kolima and follow the dirt path to the east to 
reach Kolima Bridge.

KOLIMA BRIDGE

The dude here will lower the bridge for you.

FUCHIN TEMPLE
-------------

Items
-----
 ----------------
| Psynergy Stone |
| Unicorn Ring   |
 ----------------

This isn't really even a town, but there are a quite a bit of people here to 
talk to. Your main task here is to talk to Nyunpa, who is in the temple 
meditating. Before you talk to him, you can use the Psynergy Stone right 
outside, and check a jar inside the temple for a UNICORN RING, which prevents 
the wearer from being poisoned. Using Mind Read on Nyunpa will cause him to 
notice you. He'll give you permission to enter the cave beneath the waterfall.

FUCHIN FALLS CAVE

Enemies

| Arctic Blade |
| Dragon's Eye |
| Game Ticket  |
| Orb of Force |
 --------------

Djinn

 ------------------
| Zephyr (Jupiter) |
 ------------------

The stone that you see when you enter gives you a hint at what you need to do 
to make it through the cave. Take the log to the right across the lake, and 
open the chest. This is another Mimic, and is even harder than the last one you 
fought. For defeating it, you get a GAME TICKET. In the next room, hop across 
the stumps until you reach the door on the left side of the room. Travel all 
the way to the dark room and head down the stairs.

Walk past the first log for now and hop on the one below it. It leads to a 
chest containing an ARCTIC BLADE. Have Issac equip it, and give Garet the Broad 
Axe if you only have one. Now head back and take the other log across the lake 
to enter a new area. Due to all the spikes, you'll have to travel to the south 
end of the room to reach the log that will let you pass them all.

Now you'll be back in the first room, but a different area. Ride the log across 
the lake and head through the door. Sneak past the spikes and roll the log to 
the south. Roll the vertical log to the left against the wall, and take the 
horizontal one north again. Jump on the stump in the water, and ride the 
vertical log all the way over to the Djinni, Zephyr. You'll have to fight this 
Djinni, so start out the battle by summoning Ramses, and maybe Nereid and 
Kirin. Atalanta won't do much damage. And of course, after the battle, it will 
join you. Avoid the spikes as you head to the south and ride the log north to 
the door.

In this new room, walk onto the two horizontal logs and take the top one north. 
Hop off and take the vertical one to your right to the left side of the lake. 
Hop back to dry land to the north, and head all the way to the south to take 
the other horizontal log north. Jump across to land and head down the steps. 
Here you'll find the DRAGON'S EYE. Head back up the steps, and take the other 
set of steps that lie to the north. Follow the path to a dragon statue. Placing 
the eye in the socket causes the dragon to light up the room with fire. Now you 
can see an invisible bridge that leads over the pit. Well, you can't see it... 
but you can see the shadow. 

Head back into the room with all the logs and take the log across the tiny lake 
at the bottom to enter the room with all the stumps again. Head for the door on 
the left side of the room again. You'll eventually make it to the other side of 
the dragon room where you can cross the invisible bridge. Follow this path, and 
jump down the notch in the cliff. Enter the door and pick up the Orb of Force. 
Equipping this items allows you to get the Force psynergy, which is just a big 
fist that flies out from you. The exit to the cave should be pretty 
straightforward.

Back in town, speak with Nyunpa one more time, and head out to Mogall Forest, 
to the south.

MOGALL FOREST
-------------

Enemies
-------
 -------------------
| Ape               |
| Bone Fighter      |
| Death Head        |
| Dirge             |

| Elven Shirt    |
| Nut            |
| Psynergy Stone |
 ----------------

Djinn
-----
 ----------------
| Quartz (Venus) |
 ----------------

As soon as you enter the area, you'll see an ape like creature jump into a 
stump. Mogall Forest is a maze, and if you take a wrong turn, you'll find 
yourself going in circles. Whenever you see a stump, you can use Force on it to 
scare the ape out of the stump. This causes him to run down a specific path out 
of the area, which happens to be the path you should take. Occasionally, the 
ape will jump out and attack you, but they aren't too hard. For the sake of the 
walkthrough, I'm just going to tell you which exit to take from each area.

From the first area, head south until you reach an area with logs and a river. 
If you use Force on the stump to the left, an Ape will jump out and attack you. 
Over to the right is another simple log moving puzzle, that shouldn't give you 
much trouble. 

   _
  | |             Push log 1 to the right.
 1| |             Push log 2 down.
  | |             Push log 1 to the left.
  |_|_______      Push log 2 up into the water.
    |_______|
        2

The NUT in the tree to the right is a little tricky to get. If you're in the 
corner, it won't work, so move down a step, and try from there. (Using Catch of 
course). Use the path that leads to the right. You'll eventually come across an 
area with two big stumps and four exits. Using Force on the stumps will cause 
an ape to jump out and go in a different direction. The only path you shouldn't 
take is the one to the north. Head east first, and open the chest here for an 
APPLE. I suggest giving it to Issac. Back in the area with the two stumps, head 
south.

Directly to the right of where you enter the next big area is a log with a 
stone in front of it. Use Move to get the stone out of your way, and push the 
log. Another perfectly simple log moving puzzle:

    _______
   |_______|       
       1               Push log 1 down.
                _      Push log 2 left.
               | |     Push log 1 up.
               | |     Push log 2 left into the water.
              2| |
               |_|

Now you can reach the Djinni to the south. Quartz will fight you, and then join 
you. Quartz is an extremely good Djinni in that it can bring downed party 
members back.

Now head back to the north, cross the bridge, and exit the area to the left. 
The new area has three stumps now, and four exits. Again, the north exit 
doesn't lead anywhere, but if you explore it, you'll find a Psynergy Stone. The 
exit to the left leads to an area with a chest. To get it, use Move on the 
stone to move it towards the water. Push the log against the stone, and then 
Move it again. This will let you get the ELVEN SHIRT. Since Ivan probably has 
the lowest Defense, you should give it to him, unless you want to boost Garet's 
Agility (or anyone else's for that matter). In the area with four exits, head 
south.

This area really isn't as complicated as it looks. The log to the north can be 
pushed into the water to access the stump, and the logs to the south can only 
be pushed (and only need to be pushed) a single time in a single direction. 
Take the exit to the south. This is the last area of the forest, and if you try 
to exit, an ape bigger than all the rest will jump out from the stump and 
attack.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before the battle starts out, unequip everyone's Djinn except for: Flint on 
Issac, Fever on Garet, Gust on Ivan, and Sleet on Mia. When the battle starts 
out, use these four Djinn on the Killer Ape, and the next round, summon Procne, 
Cybele, Kirin, and Nereid. If that doesn't take care of the ape, use physical 
attacks in the next round to finish it off.

Xian is a silk trading town, but business has been failing lately due to the 
meddling of Saturos and Menardi.

The fenced in area to the left as you enter the town has a jar in the upper 
left corner. Check it to find a LUCKY MEDAL. The small house above the Inn has 
a tall barrel in the back that contains an ELIXIR. The left hand door in the 
cliff face to the north of the small house contains a SLEEP BOMB in the jar 
next to the bed.

The Weapon and Armor shop in the northwest corner of town contains some very 
good (yet overly expensive) goods. Sell your Elven Rapier if you haven't 
already for a good boost in funds. For Issac and Garet, pick up an Iron Shield 
and a Battle Rapier each. For Ivan, buy a Silver Circlet, and for Mia, buy a 
Silk Robe and a Silver Circlet. You probably won't have the money to buy 
weapons for Ivan or Mia yet. 

At the north end of town, there is a woman walking back and forth with some 
water. Talking to her causes her to spill it. Talk to her when she's one step 
away from the wall, and she'll spill it in a position where you can freeze it 
with the Frost psynergy and jump across to a ledge with Mist, the Mercury 
Djinn, who joins without a fight.

When you're ready, enter the dojo at the north end of town. Use Force on the 
big log here (from behind the line), and you'll prompt a cut scene where Feh 
and his daughter Feizhi burst out of the room arguing about Hsu, Feh's son. 
You're asked to use Force again after Feizhi leaves. After the conversation, 
head to the south end of town and talk to Fehzhi. Your next destination is the 
Alpine Crossing.

When you exit the town, head straight north through some forest and across a 
bridge to an island. Wander around here for a bit to find the Mars Djinni 
Corona. Defeat it in battle, and it will join you (but you knew that by now). 
To reach the Alpine Crossing (which happens to not appear as an actual area on 
the world map), head to the south until you hit the dirt path again, and follow 
it to the west.

ALPINE CROSSING

Fehzhi will show up when you enter, but there's nothing you can do about Hsu 
now. Before you exit the area, use Frost on the puddle here, and give Issac a 
Mars Djinni to teach him Growth so he can use it on the sprout. Climb up, jump 
down the notch in the cliff, and jump across the ice pillar you made to get the 
POWER BREAD from the chest. Exit the are to the north.

ALTIN

Altin is a medium sized mining town just north of the Alpine Crossing. 
Recently, creatures called Living Statues have flooded the entire town. This 
means that the only establishment open for now is the Inn. When you enter, push 
the statue out of the way, and get the PSY CRYSTAL from inside. Head to the Inn 
next, and check the middle of the top bunk bed on the right side of second 
floor until you find a SLEEP BOMB.

When you exit the Inn, head down the ladder, and down until you see a creature 
hop into a cave. This is a Living Statue, and they are the source of the 
flooding in Altin. Follow it into the cave.

After the battle, you find a FROST JEWEL. You don't really need this I guess,

the water drains, and exit back to Atlin.

Follow the mine cart tracks for a long while (past a door and some dead ends) 
until you reach a large room with a lake. Head to the left to reach a mine 
cart. Jumping in now only takes you around a corner and back to near where you 
started. Use the switch to the right to change the direction of the track.

should get rid of him. If not, use regular attacks until he falls.

EXP   - 377 
COINS - 900
ITEM  - VIAL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the water drains, take the mine cart back to the other side of the ledge. 
Forget about the door that you uncovered in this room, as there's nothing you 
can do inside there yet. Head south out of the room and follow the tracks until 
you reach the door you passed earlier. The water will have drained in this 
area, allowing you to climb down the ladder and enter a new area.

When you reach the tracks, head left all the way to the track switch. Flip that 
and head back to the right until you reach the mine cart. Ride it to the exit 
of this area. Head left in the new area until you reach a chest. The chest is a 
mimic, so use the same strategies you've used for previous ones. You get a GAME 
TICKET for defeating it. Exit to the south into a new area. Use Frost on the 
puddle here to make a pillar that lets you jump across to the door.

You'll now be in another large room full of broken mine car tracks, and a 
Living Statue on the right side of the room. Climb down the ladder and head 
left. Use Frost on the puddle north and to the right of the first ladder you 
see, and then climb up and jump across to reach the mine cart. Jump in, and it 
will take you to a chest containing a DRAGON SHIELD. Equip it on Issac or Garet 
(whoever has the lowest Defense). Take the mine cart back and climb down the 
ladder. Head all the way left and climb up the ladder that leads to the switch. 
Hit it, go back to the mine cart, and ride to all the way to the right, where 
you can fight the next Living Statue.

Once again, I recommend the same strategy. Since your party levels up so fast 
in the mines, the battles just get easier.

Before the battle, unequip everyone's Djinn. One round of level three summons 
should get rid of him. If not, use regular attacks until he falls.

When you return to the town, you'll find that it's completely drained, and the 
Weapon and Armor shop are back in commission. The weapons and armor run at 
pretty steep prices, and you'll probably only have around 10,000 Coins right 
now. Start with armor for now. Get Chain Mail for Issac and Garet, Gauntlets 
for Mia, Ivan, and the character that doesn't have the Dragon Shield, and an 
Iron Helm for Issac and Garet. A barrel in a Weapon Shop contains 9 COINS. 
Enter Altin Peak via the lowest and most recently uncovered exit.

Follow the tracks to the right through two doors until the tracks end. Head 
south and look for the chest in the corner. It contains a LUCKY MEDAL. Follow 
the path to the right and enter a new area. You'll see a Djinni when you enter, 
but we'll get to that in a second. Head to the right and use Move on the pillar 
to move it one space left, and use Frost on the puddle to freeze it. Climb up 
the ladder to the north, hit the switch, and jump across to the mine cart. Ride 
it to the upper right area, and then jump in again and let it take you to the 
Djinni. You'll have to fight Spritz before it joins you, but one you get it, 
it's a very good Djinni (Spritz heals the entire party).

Ride the mine car back across, and head to the left, freezing the puddle. 
Continue left along the ledge, and freeze the next puddle. Climb up the ladder 
to the right of the first puddle, and hop across to the door. Follow this long 
hallway all the way to the end where you enter the upper portion of a previous 
room. Pick your way north through the rocks to find a sign and a log. Use Force 
on the log to knock an enormous boulder down and watch as it crashes through 
the floor. This is where you're headed now. Climb down the ladder and jump down 
the notch in the cliff. Interestingly enough, the mine track has now become a 
ladder that you can climb down.

Recommended level: 17

This is not a battle to be taken lightly at all. Before you start the battle, 
unequip all of Garet's Djinn so that you can summon Tiamat at the beginning of 
the battle. Whether you want to do this with other characters as well is up to 
you. 

Make good use of attack Djinn, and consider using the stat changing ones 
(especially the ones that raise your defense). Remember to use Fizz and Spritz 
frequently, because they are very very helpful at this point in the game. When 
your Djinn are on standby, use powerful psynergy attacks like Issac's Ragnarok 
and Garet's Volcano.

Power isn't everything. Issac can do lots of damage in this battle, but you'll 
also want to utilize his healing capabilities. Don't be afraid of using one of 
his turns to heal.

If you want to powerhouse your way through the battle, summon every one of your 
highest summons the first round, and then use your most powerful psynergy the 
second. That will most likely finish him off if you're at least level 17.

Pick up the LIFTING GEM from the chest. At this point, return to Altin.

All you really need to do here is rest if you need it, and buy two Claymores 
(for Garet and Issac). You'll get plenty of cash back for your Battle Rapiers. 
Now head back into the mines (the door in the middle area of the town).

Follow the tracks all the way to the long since drained out lake. Climb down 
the ladder into the lakebed and enter the door here. Use your newfound Lift 
abilities to get the chest containing a COOKIE. Issac is the best person to 
give this to, as he has a low PP, and you will be using Ragnarok and Cure a 
lot.

Head back to Altin and take the lower entrance to the mines again. This time, 
head north and use lift on the boulder behind the arrow, and enter a short 
area. Head left when you first enter the area, and use Move on the pillar to 
enter a room with a VIAL. Head back out and take the hallway to the right. Use 
Lift on the next boulder, and continue through to the world map.

LAMA TEMPLE

Heal with the Psynergy Stone if you need it, and head north and enter the 
temple to prompt a cut scene between Master Hama and Ivan. Ivan will learn 
Reveal, which will allow you to progress through the next area of the game (as 
well as uncover some items that you missed earlier; don't worry, I'll tell you 
where all of them are, there are more pressing matters at hand, namely rescuing 
Hsu... you can't backtrack yet anyway). Before you leave the town, use your new 
Psynergy Reveal on the rock to the right. Underneath is a chest with a WATER OF 
LIFE. Exit the town and head right to the Alpine Crossing.

ALPINE CROSSING
---------------

At first, it seems that you can't reach Hsu, but use Reveal. A door will open 
up in the cliff wall that leads right next to him. Use Lift on the boulder that 
he's trapped under, and Master Hama and Fehzhi will thank you. You don't 
actually get anything for doing this... but it sure was nice of you, huh? After 
that, head south to the Lamakin Desert.

 ----------------

The Lamakin Desert is too hot to simply run through. Periodically, you'll come 
across a ring of stones that you can use Reveal on to make an oasis appear and 
cool your characters off. Stepping on the lighter sand causes the gauge on the 
left side of the screen to start filling up, and the only way to bring it back 
down is to jump in an oasis. Having it fill up all the way will cause your 
characters to receive a sizeable amount of damage, and the meter will start 
from the bottom.

Your first trial run through the hot sands starts immediately. Run until you 
reach the ring of stones, and use Reveal on them to find the oasis. When you 
reach the sanctuary of the dark patch of sand, follow it until you reach 
another circle of stones. Casting Reveal will show the hidden Psynergy Stone 
here. Head north (using the oasis on the way) to the next patch of dark sand. 

At the fork here, head north, and use reveal to find a chest with a VULCAN AXE. 
Head back south to the dark sand, and use the oasis just to the south. Equip 
the Axe on Issac. Now head to the north again and take a right at the fork. The 
first ring of stones here contain an Ant Lion, a powerful enemy that you might 
want to avoid, unless you think you can take it on. The next ring of stones 
contain the oasis, and from there, head north to the next area.

The next area is pretty huge. It was easier for me to make a map than to give 
you directions around the area, so here it is. Each number or letter represents 
a ring of stones, and the key is below.

                                                 Entrance

1 - POTION
2 - PSYNERGY STONE
3 - 777 COINS
4 - LUCKY PEPPER
O - Oasis
A - Ant Lion
D - Smog Djinni

Smog will join you without a fight by the way. And the Lucky Pepper... use that 
on whoever you used the first one on (I suggested Ivan way back when).

In the new area, head to the left across two waterfalls until you reach a 
seeming dead end with a waterfall. Use Reveal and head into the new tunnel. 
Coming out the other end, let the waterfall take you off the cliff (or just 
climb down). To the right is a hidden oasis and a hidden chest with a MINT, 
which you should use on Garet. Just don't get trapped by the Ant Lion that 
lurks in the left most circle of stones.

Climb back up and head left across the waterfalls. Use Reveal on the sand 
waterfall here, and you'll be attacked by the Manticore.

Boss Fight - Manticore
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recommended level: 17          
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since the Manticore is a desert-based creature, you'll be able to hurt it very 
badly by summoning Mercury Djinn. Unequip all of Ivan and Mia's Djinn before 
the battle, and start off by summoning Boreas and Thor. Those two attacks will 
deplete over 1000 HP from the monster. Cure when you need to, and heal poison 
when necessary. Manticore will fall after about 700 HP more of damage. (Summon 
a few creatures).

 -------------------------------


It's been a while since you've had a nice big town to raid, so indulge yourself 
in Kalay. The pots near the graves to the left side of the entrance contain a 
VIAL. Also near the graves is a tree with a NUT in it. Check a barrel in the 
house in the lower right portion of town for 11 COINS. Head down the stairs in 
the Inn, and check the first barrel there for an ELIXIR. The house to the right 
of the Inn has a SMOKE BOMB in the oven, and you can get a SLEEP BOMB by 
checking the jar above the Armor shop. 

Now for stocking up on equipment. Sell your extra Claymore for some quick cash, 
and pick up the following items. For Issac, keep his Vulcan Axe (the unleash is 
worth it), and buy a Mail Cap. For Garet, buy a Great Axe and a Mail Cap. Now 
for Ivan... you're going to get a lot. Start with the Frost Wand for him, and 
then buy a Jerkin, a Heavy Armlet, and a Mail Cap. For Mia, buy the Psynergy 
Rod, a Jerkin, a Heavy Armlet, and a Mail Cap. If you can't afford all this, 
you should be close anyway, so just fight out on the world map until you have 
the money.

When you're ready, head north and enter Hammet's mansion (remember the dude 
from the beginning of the game that's STILL trapped in Lunpa?). Lady Layana 
will talk to Issac and crew for a while, and decide that it's not the time to 
go on a rescue mission. Don't worry, soon we'll go back for Hammet and get some 
other stuff that we missed as well. For now, search the barrels in the right 
wing of the mansion for a NUT. Now head back to the main portion of town.

The house in the northeastern corner has external stairs that you can climb up 
to a porch type thing, and from there jump to the cliffs that surround the 
town. Move the statue out of the way up here to reveal a cave. Move the statue 
inside to block the waterfall and drain the pool. Climb down into the pit and 
up again to reach the Mars Djinni Scorch, who joins without a fight. There's 
nothing else you can do in this sewage area yet, but we'll come back later. 

VAULT
-----

Items
-----
 ------
| Bone |
 ------

Now that the bridge has been repaired north of Kalay, you can return to the 
town of Vault to the north. The enemies in the area remain weak, so you won't 
have a problem getting there. Before you attempt the medium dungeon type area 
under Vault, go to the bell tower and ring it to flush the Djinni out of 
hiding. If you don't do this, your trek through the dungeon will be pointless! 
Once you've done that, head to the Inn, and pick up a BONE. Take this to the 
dog near the graves, and it'll move. You can use Reveal to find the entrance to 
the cave. 

VAULT CAVE
----------

Enemies
-------
 -------------
| Cave Troll  |
| Death Cap   |
| Fighter Bee |  
| Gargoyle    |
| Ghost Mage  |
| Mimic       |
| Ravager     |
 -------------

Items
-----
 ----------
| Vambrace |
| Vial     |
 ----------

Djinn
-----
 -------------
| Sap (Venus) |
 -------------

Heading to the right as you enter will bring you to a Mimic chest. Defeat it 
for a VIAL. After that, head left and continue on through some doors until you 
reach a room with two torches and a switch. I'm assuming you'd be able to 
figure it out, but just push the torch onto the switch to open the gate. 

In the next room, use Whirlwind on the ivy to uncover a room with a VAMBRACE. 
Equip this on Issac and give his Dragon Shield to Garet. Back in the previous 
room, you'll have to use Frost on the puddles to make it to the left side. In 
the next room, climb down and up the ladders (skip the stairs for now) and exit 
to the south. Take the set of stairs immediately to the right, and press the 
switch here to drain the water. Go back into the previous room and take the 
southern exit. 

Puzzle - Tricky Torches

This is actually a pretty tough puzzle, as it requires timing as well as 
thinking. You're going to have to push the torch from its starting point to the 
switch to the north. First get rid of the unlit one by pushing it down two 
spaces. Here is the way to push the lit torch:

1. Push it up one space.
2. Stand on the left side of the pillar, wait until the water drips,
   and push it like crazy to the right until you can't push it anymore.
3. Push it up as much as you can.
4. Push it left two spaces.
5. Wait for the water droplet to fall, and push it left really fast 
   again.
6. Push it down one space, then left, and then up.
7. Push it right one space. 
8. Wait for the final water droplet to fall, and push it to the right. 
9. Push it onto the switch!

Head up the stairs, enter the door to the left, head south, climb down the 
ladder, enter the door, jump across the gap, climb the ladder, head up the 
stairs to the right, and finally exit the cave. Here you'll find Sap, who will 
join you immediately. Head all the way back through the cave back into Vault. 

VALE
----

Items
-----
 ----------------
| 123 Coins      | 
| Psynergy Stone |
| Vial           |
 ----------------

A short trip across the world map will bring you back to Vale. Take a short 
trip to visit Issac's mom and Garet's family. They'll be happy to see him. 
Also, check the barn in the northeast corner of the plaza. The doors will be 
open now (they weren't in the beginning). Check a jar in the back for a VIAL, a 
box in the middle for 123 COINS, and of course, there's the pretty much useless 
Psynergy Stone sitting in the middle of the floor (considering the limitless 
large one is at the front of town). Now head back to Kraden's house and lift 
the boulder to the left of it using Lift to access a new area.

VALE CAVE

 ----------
| Halt Gem |
| Nut      |
 ----------  

Djinn
-----
 ----------------
| Kite (Jupiter) |
 ----------------

There isn't much you can do to the right or straight forward, so you'll have to 
go left. Use Reveal to uncover the hidden stepping-stone in the ring of stones, 
and hop across. In the next room, use Move on the crate to the right to get it 
out of your way. Enter the door to the south, and grab the NUT from the chest 
in this area. Head back and use push the other crate into the water to create a 
path to the log. 

Head left at first in the next area (right is a dead end), and head through the 
door at the end. Push the log off the cliff, jump the gap, push the other log 
off, and jump down. Push the horizontal log up and cross the water. The chest 
in the next area contains the HALT GEM. Equip this and approach the Djinni. 
It'll jump down and start circling around a pile of rubble. Align it so that 
the Djinni is opposite of you and use Halt on it. Just talk to it after to make 
Kite the Djinni join you. Now exit the cave.

BILIBIN CAVE
------------

Items
-----
 ---------------
| Psy Crystal   |
| Water of Life |
 ---------------

From Vale, head east on the world map, past Vault, until you reach Goma Cave. 
Use the shortcut that you made before to blast through the cave. Once you're on 
the world map again, head north and then west to Bilibin Cave.

Head back to the room with all the ice pillars. Use Douse on the small flame 
next to the puddle, and it will become an ice pillar once more. Now head back 
out to the entrance area, and use Growth on the sprout to reach the alternate 
cave entrance. Follow it to the end where the chest is, and use Reveal on the 
wall to uncover a hidden door. Use Douse on the small flame in your way. 

In the next room, jump to the ledge on the right, and use the ice pillar that 
you made to reach a door with two chests. They contain a PSY CRYSTAL and a 
WATER OF LIFE. Was it worth it to come all the way out here for these two 
items? I guess so. I did it.

KALAY
-----

Yes, you have to head all the way back to Kalay now, south of Vault. Talk to 
all the people in the tour group in the Inn, and then try to exit the town via 
the west exit. After the cut scene, head southwest on the world map to reach 
Kalay Docks.

| Water of Life |
 ---------------

You'll find the Tolbi-Bound Ship to be a place of frustration and mutiny. The 
passengers want to leave, but the Captain is hesitant because of sea monsters. 
You're going to have to get things going by yourself. 

First order of business: raid the ship of valuables! Head down the stairway in 
the middle of the deck first. The barrel at the south end of the room contains 
a LUCKY MEDAL. Head in the door behind the chef, and check a barrel here for 23 
COINS. Head to the south end of the deck to find the Captain's cabin. A really 
suspicious looking guy will run out when you get near. Enter the cabin and 
check the jar for a NUT. 

Now head back out and talk to the dude that just ran out. He's by the prow of 
the ship, and if you use Mind Read on him, you'll find that he hid the Anchor 
Charm on top of the mast. Head up there, and check around for the ANCHOR CHARM. 

Now head back into the area behind the chef again (where you found the 23 
Coins) and head north to prompt a cut scene. After they rush out, follow them 
to the Captain's quarters. After some fighting and yelling, give the Captain 
the Anchor Charm, and the ship will finally be on its merry way. Head down 
below the passenger quarters to reach where the people row. Your job is to 
protect the rowers, and select new ones if any are injured. 

Now, there's a secret area you can get to now called Crossbone Isle. If you 
want to reach it, you have to select passengers in a specific order to row. 
There are a few benefits of doing this now, and I'll continue the walkthrough 
as if you selected this course. 

After just a little bit, monsters will attack the ship.


Fight #1 - Man o' War X3

After the battle, go upstairs to choose a new oarsman. The guy you want is the 
arrogant dude in the green cape on the right side of the room. 

"Hey! You're not thinking of making me an oarsman, are you?"


Fight #2 - Lizard Fighter, Rabid Bat X2

Another oarsman is needed. The bald guy on the left side of the room is who 
you're looking for.

"What? Ohhhh, noooo... Are you going to make me row?"


Fight #3 - Virago, Man o' War X2

Now you want the chef.

"You... You must be joking. You want me to row?"


Boss Fight - Kraken
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recommended level: 20         
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Kraken is one tough customer. It packs almost 2,500 HP, and only using 
strong summons will make a big dent in that massive amount of health. Meteor, 
Judgement, and Thor will all do massive damage. The damage cause by Boreas will 
be muted due to the Kraken's resistance to water. 

Other than summons, use strong psynergy and attack Djinn. Ragnarok and Tornado 
are good psynergies to use. It should only have about 400 HP left once you've 
summoned all your Djinn. 

EXP   - 711
COINS - 5200
ITEM  - WATER OF LIFE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the battle, you need to select one more rower. Choose the old man in the 
bottom left. 

"Out of all these people, you're asking a frail old man like me to row?"

This combination of oarsman will take you to Crossbone Isle, and you'll have a 
whole new place to explore. You're asked to disembark and scout ahead.

At first, there doesn't seem to be anything of interest on the isle. It's also 
strangely devoid of enemies. However, you can enter an area if you walk in 
between all the mountains. Use Growth on the first three sprouts here to get to 
the highest level (the ivy on the way doesn't hide anything). Head right from 
here to grab a NUT from the tree.

Now, drop down the right hand crack in the cliff, and open the chest here for a 
MINT. Back at the top, slide down the middle crack and open this chest for 1 
COIN (cool...). Once again, back at the top, take the left most crack down and 
blow away the ivy with Whirlwind to reveal the entrance to the cave.

This dungeon is comprised of many different layers. They each start out with a 
powerful enemy that you have to fight, and then there's a puzzle inside the 
room that you have to solve to continue, and there are many treasures to be had 
as well. Head down to reach the first door. 

Floor 1
-------

Boss Fight - Hobgoblin, Virago X2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recommended level: 20         
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unequip four Djinn of your two fastest characters (most likely Ivan and Issac). 
Summon these Djinn immediately, and you should win the battle.

EXP   - 397
COINS - 1040
ITEM  - LUCKY MEDAL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run all the way to the right around the perimeter of the room to get an 
ANTIDOTE. Back at the beginning, as if you had just come out of the door, jump 
across the block below the stone pillar. Move it to the left, and jump across 
to the chest to get a NUT. Exit the area to reset the stone, and enter again.

This time, move that stone pillar to the right, and collect 111 COINS from the 
chest. Move the next stone pillar to the right to reach a chest with a HARD 
NUT. Once again, leave the room to reset the pillars. This time, move the 
second pillar to the left, and then the third pillar to the right. For the 
fourth pillar, you'll have to move it to the middle of the platform, jump to 
the right to circle back around, and then move the fourth pillar to the right 
one more time. This will lead you to the exit of the room. 

When you exit, you can fight the Mimic here. Summons should make short work of 
it. You receive a POTION for winning. After the battle, push the stone pillar 
into the pit as a shortcut.

Floor 2
-------

Boss Fight - Succubus, Grisly X2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recommended level: 20         
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Three or four high-powered summons will take care of these enemies in a single 
round. 

EXP   - 587
COINS - 1543
ITEM  - POTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the this new room, open the chest in front of you for an ELIXIR. The chest 
to the right contains 222 COINS. The chest to the right of that one contains a 
LUCKY PEPPER. Push the pillar to the left of this chest to the left. Push the 
horizontal pillar under it up, and then do the same for the other horizontal 
pillar you can reach. Push the vertical pillar to the right, and then push the 
remaining horizontal pillar up. The last chest contains a MYSTERY BLADE. Equip 
this on Issac. 

Floor 3 
-------

Boss Fight - Lich, Fiendish Ghoul X2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recommended level: 20         
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once again, just use the usual strong summon technique to waste the enemies the 
first turn. 

EXP   - 437
COINS - 1418
ITEM  - PSY CRYSTAL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This room is a little weird. If you want to get all the treasures, you'll have 
to use Catch to grab all the keys lying around the area. If you want to just 
exit the area, you can grab that specific key and skip all the chests, but it's 
worth it to grab them all.

You'll see the first key right away. You can grab it immediately without even 
jumping to any platforms. Stand on the protrusion and use Catch to get the 
first BLUE KEY. Head to the right, and do a little u-turn with the stepping-
stones to get into position to grab the second BLUE KEY from the right side. 
Head back to the left, and head up when you have the chance. You'll be able to 
nab the third BLUE KEY from here. Head back to the entrance, and use the stones 
on the left to reach the stone above the fourth key. Grab this final BLUE KEY, 
and jump across to the blue doors in the back. 

They contain, in order from left to right, 333 COINS, a FAIRY RING, a COOKIE, 
and a SMOKE BOMB. South of this last chest, jump on the different colored 
stone. Use reveal to uncover the final key. Use Catch to get the RED KEY, and 
use it to exit the area. 

Floor 4 
-------

Boss Fight - Gryphon X2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recommended level: 20         
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The usual cheap tactic works here: three or four strong summons do the trick 
the first round. If not, just use regular attacks the second round, and it's a 
sure win.

EXP   - 606
COINS - 3800
ITEM  - POTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is where your expeditions of Crossbone Isle fall short. You won't be able 
to get through this room without the Cloak psynergy, but rest assured I'll 
guide you through later. All the statues in this room will block your way if 
they see you. You can use Halt on some of them, however, and this will allow 
you to get a treasure for now. Use Halt on the statue directly in front of you 
(when it's not in the way of the passageway) to get a SLEEP BOMB.

Now all you can do is return to the ship. You should be pretty rich, with a few 
extra items now.

Before you hit the world map, check the crate at the north end of the dock for 
35 COINS, and arrange the crates behind the fence so that you can jump across 
and get the POTION.

| Ground (Venus) |
| Hail (Mercury) |
 ----------------

Head west past Tolbi for now and cross the bridge leading north. There's 
another bridge to the northwest that leads south onto a small area of land. Run 
around here to encounter Hail, the Mercury Djinni. Head back across that 
bridge, and head right along the dirt path. Ignore the next bridge that you 
come across and head right until you reach the Kalay Docks again. You'll be 
able to enter the area from the north and get the Venus Djinni Ground. (You'll 
notice that the Djinni will join whoever has the empty space; most likely 
Garet, if you're just being traditional; anyway, this is only temporary, and 
you'll be able to fix it once we get the Djinni in Tolbi. So head back there 
now.

Wooh. Big town, eh? It's time to start raiding! In the bottom left corner of 
the town is a circle of gravestones. Use Reveal to get some POWER BREAD. The 
room above the Weapon shop has a LUCKY MEDAL. On the very right side of the 
town from where you can see a sprout and a puddle, check the jar for another 
LUCKY MEDAL. In the upper left corner of town, check a bucket to the left of a 
house to get 9 COINS. The house to the right of this one contains a VIAL.

Get as close as you can to the entrance of town without going out to the world 
map, and walk to the right. Use Growth on the sprout here, and freeze the 
puddle with Frost. Go back around to the front of the Inn, and grab Ember, the 
Mars Djinni. Now you can return Issac's Djinni back to him. 

Lucky Dice
----------

This is the least helpful of the mini games in Tolbi. Basically, you bet money 
(your level X 10) to roll the dice. There are two dice, but it's like there are 
four dice since the spaces that the dice land in are displayed as dice. So 
basically, if you get two of a kind, you get your money back, if you get three 
of a kind, you get twice your bet, and four of a kind is three times your bet. 
There is also a perfect bonus. If you roll a perfect in one of the displayed 
suits, you get your winnings multiplied by either three or five. Not a very 
reliable way to make money, unfortunately. 

Lucky Wheels
------------

You'll find this mini game in the upper right corner of town above the Inn. 
This is the most helpful mini game, in my opinion. Basically, it's a slot 
machine, and you get prizes depending on which picture you line up. Use Game 
Tickets to bet and get more rows (to increase your chance of winning). You pull 
the lever 5 times, and each time, you get to hold any rows that you want. 

The prizes include:

Hearts
------
Vial
Nut

Stars
-----
Elixir
Psy Crystal

Rings
-----
Sleep Ring
War Ring
Adept Ring

Shirts
------
Running Shirt
Silk Shirt
Mythril Shirt

Boots
-----
Fur Boots
Quick Boots
Hyper Boots

The cheap way to do this is to save before you try the game, and keep resetting 
until you get the item you want. First off, get a War Ring for Issac and Garet, 
and maybe Ivan and Mia if you want. Remember to only spend one ticket per item, 
and reset if you don't get the one you want. Get a Silk Shirt for Mia (a great 
item because it goes on under her armor). If you're lucky, you can get Mythril 
Shirts for all four characters (even better than Mia's Silk Shirt). There's 
definitely a toss up between the Hyper Boots and Quick Boots. Hyper Boots will 
be more useful later on down the road when you're using a lot of physical 
attacks, but you'll probably want to stick with the Quick Boots for now. 

Sell all the extra crap that you win to the Weapon shop for some major fundage. 

Lucky Fountain
--------------

The last mini game takes place in the middle of town in a giant fountain. You 
throw the Lucky Medals that you've been collecting into the fountain, and try 
to avoid the animals. The closer the medal lands to the middle, the better the 
prizes you get.

You can use the same cheap saving and resetting trick, but you won't be able to 
get as many items as you did with the slots, seeing as Lucky Medals are much 
harder to come by. 

Here's what you can win:

Battle Gloves
Guardian Armlet
Earth Shield
Ninja Hood
Adept's Helm
Glittering Tiara
Kimono
Cocktail Dress
Spirit Armor
Assassin Blade
Burning Axe
Grievous Mace
Potion
Psy Crystal 
Water of Life

Once again, sell any excess equipment.

Now finally, you should hit the shops and buy any equipment that looks good. 
This is what your characters should look like now (more or less):

Issac                         Garet
-----                         -----

Assassin Blade                Great Sword
Ninja Hood                    Steel Helm
Vambrace                      Earth Shield
Spirit Armor                  Spirit Armor
Quick Boots                   Quick Boots
War Ring                      War Ring 
Mythril Shirt                 Running Shirt


Ivan                          Mia
----                          ---

Master Rapier                 Grievous Mace
Guardian Circlet              Guardian Circlet
Guardian Armlet               Heavy Armlet
Silver Vest                   Cocktail Dress
Hyper Boots                   Hyper Boots
Healing Ring                  War Ring
Mythril Shirt                 Mythril Shirt


Be happy, some of the equipment you have is the strongest in the game (the 
boots at least). Your characters are powerhouses. 

Now that all that is finally over, you can continue with the quest. In the 
upper left corner of town, two guards come rushing at you asking if you know a 
missing person that they show you. After they run off, head north to Babi's 
Palace. Head up the stairs all the way to the right until you reach the top 
floor. Search the barrel here for a LUCKY MEDAL. Head up one of the two central 
staircases now, and go down the hallway. After eavesdropping on Iodem, head 
left and down the stairs into the laboratory. One of the jars here contains a 
HARD NUT. 

Now head back upstairs and walk to the right side of the room. Go upstairs to 
meet a character that will become much more important later on, and go 
downstairs through a hall to see the beginning trials of Colosso. Now you 
should start your search for Babi in the Altmiller Cave to the north.

| Squall (Jupiter) |
 ------------------

As you make your way through the first area, it will get progressively darker. 
In the second room, the darkness is complete, and you will only be able to 
really see when you're near a torch. You can also use Reveal to find your way 
through. Head down the steps.

To the right, you'll immediately see a chest. This is actually a Mimic, but you 
should be a seasoned Mimic fighter by now, and it won't be a problem. For 
winning, you get a WATER OF LIFE. Now head to the northwest. On the way, you'll 
find Babi. He needs you to travel deeper into the cave to get some of his 
special draught. The rock switches that you'll have to press are in this order, 
from left to right: blue, green, white, yellow, and red. Remember that for 
later, even if it doesn't make much sense now. 

In the next area, you can see another doorway immediately, but there are rocks 
blocking your path. Before you start picking your way through the rocks though, 
head left until you reach a wall, and then go up and right. The chest here 
contains a VIAL. Now make your way around the perimeter of the area to spiral 
into the other door. 

You'll be in a lit area again. There's a pillar-pushing puzzle that adds a 
little touch to the previous ones.

Puzzle - More Pillar Pushing Mania
----------------------------------

         _______
        |_______|3

      _                A. Push pillar 1 to the right.
     | |               B. Push pillar 2 up.
     | |               C. Freeze the puddle.
    1| |               D. Push pillar 2 down.
     |_|____P          E. Push pillar 1 to the left.
     |_______|         F. Push pillar 3 down.
         2

The P is the puddle of water. 

This will let you get to Squall, the Jupiter Djinni. You'll have to fight him 
first, unfortunately. Push the rock pillar down into the pit on the right side 
of the room and jump across to the stairs.

It's once again dark, and there's another maze of rocks that you'll have to 
navigate. If you head left while staying on the north side of the room, you'll 
eventually make it to a chest with a COOKIE. Head back to where you entered the 
room. To reach the other door, stay on the south wall of the room and head 
left. You'll reach a big cluster of rocks. Pass them to the south, and then 
turn around and find your way through so that you can head upwards. This will 
eventually take you to the stairs down.

Don't bother pushing around the pillars in this room. Head south up the stairs 
and walk along the cliff until you can drop down and head through the door. The 
next room is the room that Babi was talking about. The five stones on the 
ground correspond to the five colors that he was talking about. Those colors 
again, from left to right, are: blue, green, white, yellow, and red. 

To activate the puzzle, you must first turn the left and right hand rocks. A 
wheel of colors will begin to spin. When it stops, the top color will start 
blinking. Turn the corresponding rock to proceed. Just do this twice, and the 
door will open. Inside, pick up the MYSTIC DRAUGHT.

Now head back to Babi (use Retreat to speed things up), and give him the 
Draught. After the conversation, you're invited into Colosso, and Babi is 
escorted back to Tolbi. Head there yourself.

Before you do anything, give Mia a Venus Djinni to make her learn Growth 
(preferably a Djinni that you may not use a lot, like Granite), and give her 
the Halt Gem. Give the Douse Drop and Frost Jewel to Ivan, and give Garet the 
Orb of Force. Trade one of Issac's Djinn (maybe Ground this time) for one of 
Garet's, so that Issac learns Growth. You'll see why in a second. 

Head to the Coliseum Entrance. The guards there will recognize you and place 
you in the tournament. The basic rules are as follows: You and your opponent 
start at opposite ends of the field, and race to the center to get the better 
of the two items sitting there. On the way, you must solve puzzles and pick up 
items that will aid you in battle. All of your normal equipment is taken off, 
and your items can't be brought into the tournament either. 

There's a trick that will help you though. Your friends, while they can't 
technically participate in the battle, can help you out by tampering with the 
puzzles before hand. This allows you to get to the center much faster than you 
normally could.

When you're asked to choose where to cheer from, place Garet in the first area, 
Ivan in the second, and Mia in the third. Save and talk to the guard when 
you're ready. Before the round begins, you can help out using Garet, Ivan, and 
Mia. With Garet, use Move on the stone to place it in the middle of the gap, so 
Issac won't have to move the other stone himself. With Ivan, use Douse on the 
platform to weigh it down and raise the other one. With Mia, use Growth on the 
sprout so that Issac can just skip the entire section.

In the first area, jump across the stone that Garet helped you with, and then 
push the pillar out of the way for a Nut. Area two has nothing of value, and 
Ivan already helped you with it, so just run on through. In area three, climb 
the vine and grab the Oil Drop from the chest. To get the chest in section 
four, ride the vertical log to the right, ride the horizontal one down, and 
then ride the vertical log to the left again. The chest here contains another 
Nut. When you reach the middle, you'll pick up the Iron Shield (assuming you 
made it before the other guy did).

Boss Fight - Azart
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recommended level: 22         
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use your Oil Drop in this battle to cause some damage. Sap is a good Djinni to 
use, because it will hurt the enemy, and restore your HP. Make good use of 
Planet Diver and your Nuts.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now you get to pick where you're going to place Garet, Ivan, and Mia again. 
Place Mia in the second section, Ivan in the third, and Garet in the fifth. 
When you have control of Garet, use Force on the splintered log to create a 
bridge. With Ivan, use Frost on the puddle on the left, and finally with Mia, 
use Halt on the guy that's pulling the levers. 

The first section is a simple maze that you can blow through, the second 
section is a cinch thanks to Mia, and the third section just consists of 
rolling to the left with the lower log, and jumping across by using the ice 
pillar that Ivan made. You can get the chest in the fourth section, but it's 
not worth the time. Just climb to the top of the wall, and drop down the middle 
slide to land on the platform. Continue left, and get the chest if you want. To 
pass the fifth area quickly, climb down and use the bridge that Garet made. 
You'll get the Chain Mail, if you make it on time.

Boss Fight - Satrage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recommended level: 22         
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The same strategy applies to this battle. Use Sap and Flint (or a summons if 
you didn't set them after the last battle), and continue pounding away with 
Planet Diver and healing with Nuts. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the last round, and the longest as well. Place Ivan in the first area, 
Mia in the third, and Garet in the fifth. Have Garet use Force on the log to 
break the conveyor belt, Ivan use Frost to freeze the puddle and raise the 
platform, and Mia use Halt on the dude to freeze the pusher thingies. 

Jump across the pits in the first area, and grab the Smoke Bomb from the chest. 
Jump across the pillars in the second area, and run straight through the third. 
Get the Nut out of the chest at the end. In the fourth area, use Growth on the 
sprout, and climb to the top of the wall. Run across the conveyor belt, and 
push the stone pillars out of the way in the sixth section to push the log into 
the water, so that you can jump across. (You could grab the chest in area six, 
but you may not have time. It's a Sleep Bomb). Grab the Claymore when you get 
to the center. 

Boss Fight - Navampa
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recommended level: 22         
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use your Smoke Bomb and the Sleep Bomb if you managed to get it. Heal with Nuts 
if you need it, and just pound away with Flint and Sap, and summoning Ramses. 
This is a tough battle to win. If you summon your Mars Djinni that you equipped 
to Issac, you will get your old psynergy back and be able to use Ragnarok and 
Cure Well. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regardless of the outcome of the battle, Issac blacks out from exhaustion. 
After you wake up, head upstairs to the throne room to talk to Babi. You'll get 
a LURE CAP if you won the competition. If you follow Babi down to his room, he 
will lend you the CLOAK BALL. Talk to the guy at the booth in the middle of 
town for some CORN. Head southeast from Tolbi to reach Gondowan Cave. This will 
take us back to Kalay, and from there we can go all the way back to Lunpa and 
finally rescue Hammet.

There's a fork right at the beginning of the cave. Take a left, as right is a 
dead end for now. In the next area, use Lift on the boulder and head on under. 
Keep walking past the stepping-stones and pick up the APPLE from the chest. Use 
the stepping-stones and get the LUCKY MEDAL. Continue to the right. When you 
get to the stump, use Move to push it into the water and clear the way (as well 
as make a shortcut back to the right fork you passed earlier). Push the rock 
pillar into the crack to the right, and exit to the world map.

WEST LUNPA CAVE
---------------

From where you exit the cave, head all the way north past Vault until you reach 
Lunpa. You can't force your way in through the front gates, so head in the cave 
near town. Use Frost on the puddle under the door to raise it.

 ---------------

There really isn't much that you can do in Lunpa for now. The town is sealed 
off, the Inn is closed, and the various shops are out of stock. There is a 
pretty big payoff you can get almost immediately, however. At the north end of 
the town, between the two big logs, is a rock. Use Reveal to uncover a puddle. 
Freeze it and hop across (without leaving the Revealed area). Walk all the way 
around to the left side of town to a seeming dead end. If you use Reveal on the 
wall, you'll uncover a switch that opens the door to a giant stash of treasure. 
The chests contain: a WATER OF LIFE, 44 COINS, a SMOKE BOMB, a LUCKY MEDAL, and 
ELIXIR, and an ANTIDOTE.

Once you've done that, head through the exit at the north end of town. 

The guards here are as unrelenting as ever, but now that you have the Cloak 
psynergy and some shade, you can sneak right by! Just stand in the shadows on 
the left side of the area, use Cloak, and you'll be inside in no time.

 -----------------

Head through the first door. You'll be faced with a couple of paths to go from 
here. The door in the wall just leads to a room a with a few people to talk to. 
Head to the right instead, and put your Cloak psynergy on before you attempt to 
walk behind the guard here. Also, don't walk into the light, or the psynergy 
will wear off, and you'll be brought back to the beginning. Stay in the shadows 
as long as you can, and enter the door.

In the next room, slap Cloak on again, and head for the door in the north wall. 
The old dude here won't have much in the way of items, but if you check the 
pots to the right, you'll find a VIAL. Back in the previous room, sneak past 
the guard again and head through the door to the left.

The next room contains a guard that moves around. When he's occupied in the 
upper left, slap Cloak on and run past to the door to the south. In the next 
room, Cloak again and head up the steps.

In this room, head to the north while avoiding the guards patrolling back and 
forth. In the next room, skip the door in front of you and take the one to the 
right. You'll have to fight three Brigands here, but they shouldn't give you 
much trouble. Head through into the next room and fight another Brigand here. 
In the room to the north, you'll find Donpa and his attendant. There isn't 
anything you can do in this room right now, but remember it for later.

Back in the previous room, head south. Sneak past the guard here (study his 
pattern first) and enter the next room. You can use Catch to grab the CELL KEY 
sitting on the table. When you unlock the cell, the Brigand will attack, but 
that won't be a problem. Head down the stairs to the right. 

Back down on the first floor, take note of this area you're in. The stairs down 
are where you're headed, but there are a few treasures to get first. Take the 
door in this room that isn't a staircase. Back in this room, sneak past the 
guards to the door in the upper right. Head through the next room using Cloak 
again and you'll be back in the room with first moving guard. This time, wait 
until he's patrolling at the south end, and run to the gate to unlock it. The 
treasure room here contains an ELIXIR, a LUCKY MEDAL, 100 COINS, and a MYTHRIL 
CIRCLET. Equip this on either Ivan or Mia (whoever has the lower Defense).

Now head back to that room that I told you to remember with the staircase that 
went down into the basement. Head down and use Whirlwind on the ivy to reveal a 
blank section of wall. Use Reveal to uncover a hidden switch that opens the 
door. In the next room, head right and use Whirlwind again on the ivy here, and 
head through the door. The middle cell contains some POWER BREAD. Head out of 
the room using the door to the left. Unlock the cell door and push the crate 
out until it falls of the ledge. Use it to jump to the edge to the left, and 
unlock the cell door. Use Whirlwind once more on the ivy, and use Reveal to 
uncover another switch.

In the next room, head through the cell to find Master Hammet and prompt a cut 
scene. Before you know it, you're hurled into a boss battle!

Boss Fight - Toadonpa
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recommended level: 22         
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a pretty tough battle. Toadonpa has the ability to restore its HP after 
each round, and its attacks are pretty mean. It can also poison you, which you 
should remedy immediately if that happens. Summon your Djinn until you have 
everyone's fourth level summon available. One last round of summoning the Djinn 
should destroy the creature. 

Remember to use Issac to Cure as well, since it's very tempting to attack 
constantly with him.

EXP   - 999
COINS - 3200
ITEM  - PSY CRYSTAL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the battle, your team members discuss the fate of Dodonpa. Don't worry 
about seriously having to choose one way or another, as Dodonpa's father will 
come in and settle things his way. After the discussion, you automatically head 
back into town.

Ooooohooohohoo. The weapons here are very very expensive. As for weapons, buy 
the Shamshir for Issac, the Ninja Blade for Ivan, and the Dragon Axe for Garet. 
It's not worth it to pick up the Demonic Staff, since it's cursed. For Issac's 
armor, get Plate Mail, a Silver Helm, and the War Gloves. For Garet, get the 
Plate Mail and Silver Helm. Ivan should get a Silver Armlet. Mia should get the 
Silver Armlet, the Platinum Circlet, and the Blessed Robe.

Now that is cool. You're outfitted with some pretty nice gear. 

Now head back to Kalay to return Hammet. You'll have to sneak out via the cave 
again, and you'll meet someone on the way. He'll offer a wagon ride back to 
Kalay.

Head north to the Mansion to talk to Hammet and see what's up. After that, head 
back into town, and enter the sewers via the entrance behind the statue in the 
upper right corner of town. Head north and up the stairs. Heading to the left 
you'll find two halls leading to the north. Take the first one and grab the 
four chests here for a SLEEP BOMB, a POTION, a LUCKY MEDAL, and 200 COINS. Push 
the statue in front of the waterfall to drain the reservoir thingy. Use Frost 
on the puddle and jump across to grab the chest, which contains SPIRIT GLOVES. 
Head back north up the stairs, and head left to the other set of stairs. Go up 
a few flights into a cave area with an APPLE. Head outside and grab the NUT 
from the tree.

Also, five billion people emailed me and told me that there's a Water Jacket
in a chest in Hammet's mansion, bottom left near some beds. I guess.

Now head all the way back to Lunpa.

GONDOWAN PASSAGE

Head all the way back to Tolbi through the Gondowan Cave and south from there 
to reach a bridge. This is where you'll meet Iodem. Back on the world map, 
follow the dirt path to Suhalla.

Head for the house in the lower right section of town. Iodem will recognize the 
wounded soldiers here, and speak with them. They'll tell you about the dangers 
of the desert, and then they fall back asleep, or go unconscious, or whatever. 

There are a few items you can get while you're here. In the small house to the 
left of the one with the wounded soldiers, there's a SMOKE BOMB in the oven. To 
the right of the healing shrine to the north is an area where you can jump 
across the river. Jump back across to the left side of the shrine and check the 
jar for a LUCKY MEDAL. Hop back across and head to the left to pick up a HARD 
NUT from the chest. Exit the town and enter again to appear at the normal 
entrance. Directly to the south as you enter is a jar nestled in some crates. 
Inside is 5 COINS.

Suhalla Desert isn't really a big area (it's smaller than Lamakin). Your main 
problem will be dealing with the sheer power of the enemies here. 

From where you enter the desert, head right until you reach your first 
windstorm. Set Douse to a shortcut (since you'll be using it a lot in the 
desert) and cast it when you get caught up in the windstorm. Doing so causes 
the whirlwind to die out and also makes a Tornado Lizard appear. Failure to do 
so will cause the whirlwind to deposit you back at town. Tornado Lizards are 
fairly difficult, but not strong enough to be considered a boss at this point, 
especially if you are at least level 23. Just use attack Djinn, and the 
creature will fall in one or two rounds.

Once you've conquered the windstorm, check the chest behind it for a VIRTUOUS 
ARMLET. Heading left from the entrance brings you to another windstorm. Conquer 
the lizard inside, and continue onward. When you come to a large area with 
paths to the south and east, take either of the two southern paths (and fight 
the lizard) to reach a chest. The chest is a Mimic, and defeating it gets you a 
WATER OF LIFE.

Take the path to the east now. After yet another fight with a Tornado Lizard, 
you'll be able to enter a new area to the left.

The first path to the north is blocked by a windstorm, but a treasure chest 
with a LUCKY MEDAL lies beyond. Skip the second path to the north and take the 
third one. Another lizard, and a chest with a COOKIE. Head north through the 
second path past yet another lizard. Using Reveal when you climb down the cliff 
into the sand will reveal footprints. Follow them north to where they cross a 
cliff (with a stone that appears when you use Reveal). Jump across and climb 
down to get the Mars Djinni Flash. You'll have to fight it first, though. This 
is one of the most useful Djinn in the game. Using it in battle will 
significantly decrease the amount of damage done to you for a round. The damage 
usually is in the 1-15 range, which can be a lifesaver in tougher battles.

The door behind the Djinn leads through a cave to a walled off section of the 
desert. A huge windstorm sits here, but you'd be better off waiting a little 
bit before fighting the creature inside or using the windstorm itself. If you 
let it carry you away, you'll land on Crossbone Isle. You can't quite finish 
the rest of it yet, but you will be able to very very soon, so we'll get right 
back to it. 

Jump back across the stone platform that you have to make appear with Reveal, 
and continue south. When you start walking on the sand, another big windstorm 
chases you down and sweeps you up. 

Boss Fight - Storm Lizard
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recommended level: 24         
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fighting the Storm Lizard is like fighting a gigantic version of all the 
Tornaro Lizards you've been fighting. Unleash your attack and defense Djinn 
during the battle, keep your characters healed, and summon your level 4 
summons. There's not really much else you can do to make this battle easier. 
Tough it out. 

EXP   - 1300
COINS - 6100
ITEM  - PSY CRYSTAL

After the battle, you can leave the desert to the south (pick up the Psynergy 
Stone on the way by casting Reveal in the middle of the ring of stones).

Head up the steps in this area, and talk with another pair of wounded guards. 
At least it means you're on the right track. There's a healing shrine to the 
north if you need it. Head right into the first big section of the area. If you 
drop off the first notch in the cliff, you'll land on a ledge with a MINT. 
Climb back up using the vines, and continue right. 

In the next area, jump down the third notch in the cliff. You'll land right 
next to Dew, the Mercury Djinni. You'll have to fight it first before you can 
get it. Jump down from here, and head right. After climbing up the first vine, 
you'll see a cave. You can go in, pick up the psynergy stone, and exit to the 
world map, but it's a dead end. There is a little conversation about what you 
find there, however, if you want to check it out. Regardless of whether you do 
that or not, take the next couple vines up and head to the right again. Head 
east on the world map to reach the Venus Lighthouse.

Saturos' and Menardi's path couldn't be more obvious. Follow the trail of dead 
and dying people to entrance of the lighthouse. Walk through the first room, 
and then in the second, use Reveal to uncover a door in the wall of the central 
column thing. Go down and pick up the CARRY STONE. This allows you to use the 
Carry Psynergy, which is a little like Move, but allows you to lift the object 
you're moving. It's also the last item you need to finish Crossbone Isle. We'll 
get back to is after we finish business in the lower portions of the 
lighthouse.

Go back up the steps, and head north. Head to the right, and take the stairs 
down. Jump across all the stones, and head up the steps again to reach a chest 
with a LUCKY CAP. Equip this on Ivan if you've been boosting his Luck with the 
Lucky Peppers. Head down, jump back across the stones, and head up again. This 
time, go to the left. You can head up the steps, but it's only a dead end 
(except for a guy you can talk to). Instead, take the door to the upper right. 
Use Carry on the strange looking block here to drop it off the edge to the 
right and head up the stairs. You can't get past the electrical field yet, but 
use Reveal next to the stairs to reveal yet another set of stairs. 

Head up the steps and talk to the statue at the top of the room. There will be 
a temporary glow and the pattern on the floor will change. This won't make much 
sense yet, but you can keep it like this (or talk to the statue again to change 
it). Keep the path like this for now for the sake of the walkthrough. You 
wouldn't want to be confused when I talk about it later, would you? WOULD YOU? 
Okay, good. 

Anyway, get out of the lighthouse, and head back to the desert.

it reappear. Here's a strategy if you choose to fight:

chest in the upper right corner contains STORM GEAR. The chest in the upper 
left contains 444 COINS. The chest on the way out contains a PSY CRYSTAL.

Don't forget that you have an enemy fight before each room.

Four fourth level summons will severely weaken the Lizard King and get rid of 
all the other enemies. A couple more rounds of regular attacks or attack Djinn

The puzzle in this room is like the one in the forest from the beginning of the 
game. You'll have to move the logs around and then raise the water level to 
reach chests and the exit. In the upper right corner of the room, you'll find 
555 COINS. Now, here's what the logs look like:

For a chest with a LUCKY MEDAL:

A. Push log 1 to the left.
B. Push log 4 up.
C. Push log 1 to the right.

Using the new configuration, this is how to get the chest with NINJA GARB:

A. Push log 5 to the left. 
B. Push log 1 to the left.
C. Push log 4 down.
D. Push log 2 down.
E. Push log 5 to the right.

A. Push log 1 to the left.
B. Push log 5 to the left.
C. Push log 4 up.
D. Push log 1 to the right.
E. Push log 4 down.

You can grab a chest with a POTION here. Exit the area to the south.

EXP   - 930
COINS - 1600
ITEM  - POTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Head to the upper left and push the rock pillar with the chest on it up into 
the alcove. Back in the lower right, move the rock pillars so that you can jump 
across to the ledge. The chest here contains an ELIXIR. Head down the small 
ladder and up the big one. To the left, you'll see a Venus Djinn, Bane. 
Approach it, and it will start to run away. Skip the ladder, and head left and 
down. Push the stone pillar off the cliff via the notch. Hop down after it, and 
use Frost on the puddle. Jump across and grab another chest with 666 COINS.

When you approach the Djinni, it'll run away again. Push the stone column down 
in front of the big ladder. If you climb down the big ladder, you'll be able to 
stand on the pillar and jump across to the chest (assuming you pushed it into 
position earlier). The chest contains a DEMON AXE. This is a great weapon, but 
you can't equip it without being cursed. That will all change, however, once 
you get a certain item, and that will be soon. So DON'T get rid of the Axe, 
it's one of the strongest weapons in the game.

Follow the Djinni to the right, and then down. He'll start running around a few 
stone bricks like the Jupiter Djinn did when you first got Halt. Use Halt again 
to get the Djinni.

Back on the left side of the room, push the rock pillar that's located near the 
ice pillar to the right. You'll have to pull the stone using Move, because 
you'll want to end up north of the stone. Climb the ladder to the north, and 
jump across to the chest containing a WATER OF LIFE. Exit the area to the 
south.

Floor 7

Boss Fight - Earth Lizard X2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Earth Lizards have the Cure Well psynergy, so start of the battle by using 
Seal on them. Finish both of them off using summons and attacks.

ITEM  - WATER OF LIFE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This next area is a little weird. Head up and to the left to reach one of the 
stones that you can use Carry on. Push in into the corner to the right, and use 
Carry on it to place it between the two ledges. This lets you jump across to 
the right when you climb up the ladder. The chest here contains a LUCKY MEDAL. 
Now exit the area, and come back in to reset the block. Lift the same block up 
onto the platform to the left. Jump across the gap to the left, and lift the 
block another level higher so that you can reach the chest. It contains a PSY 
CRYSTAL.

Exit the area again, and come back in. Place the same block on the platform to 
the left, and then drop it off the other side. Position it so that you can jump 
to the edge to the left. The chest that you can reach from here contains a 
WICKED MACE. This is another cursed item, so don't equip it, but save it.

Make your way to the bottom left corner where the other block is. Move it over 
to the left and lift it up onto the ledge. Jump across and head towards the 
exit. Before you leave, jump across to the chest (you can do it, just hug the 
wall) and open it for 777 COINS.

Floor 8
-------

Boss Fight - Poison Toad, Thunder Lizard X2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recommended level: 25         
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your strongest summons won't be enough to take down the Poison Toad. You'll 
probably want to keep someone healing for the whole battle, as the attacks by 
the Thunder Lizards will keep you on your toes. Use Flash as much as you can 
during the battle.

EXP   - 2576
COINS - 2642
ITEM  - WATER OF LIFE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Head north in this area, and use Frost on the puddle under the platform. Jump 
over the puddle, head up the ladder, and jump across to the chest that contains 
a SMOKE BOMB. Exit the area and return to melt the ice pillar. Jump over the 
puddle again, and freeze it from this side. Use it to jump across the ledge, 
and grab the chest here, which contains 888 COINS.

Head down the ladder, and push the stone that's underneath the logs to the 
right. Jump back across the ice pillar, and fall down the notch in the cliff. 
Push the log down, and then use Frost on the puddle under the platform to melt 
the other ice pillar. Jump back across, and freeze it from the other side. Head 
left and climb down. Push the other log down to reach a chest with a CLERIC'S 
RING. This is the item that you need to equip cursed items. Resist the 
temptation to equip the ring and the Demon Axe. A better cursed weapon is 
coming up soon, and if you equip the axe now, you won't be able to get it of 
until you visit a healing shrine.

Jump across the puddle to the left, and freeze it from the top. Jump across and 
grab the POTION.

Floor 9

Boss Fight - Cerebus X2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recommended level: 26

This battle isn't as hard as the previous one. Start off by summoning your 
fourth level summons, and then finish them off the next few rounds with 
powerful psynergy and attacks.

ITEM  - PSY CRYSTAL

This floor is pretty simple compared to some of the other ones you've seen. 
Head for the log in the upper right corner of the room and ride it to the left. 
Jump across and grab the SLEEP BOMB out of the chest.

There are two horizontal logs at the south part of the lake, and three vertical 
logs on the east part of the lake. Ride the left-hand horizontal log up to 
reach a log in the upper left. Ride this over to the right, and ride the other 
horizontal log up. Ride the vertical log in the upper right corner to the left, 
and jump down to the log sitting in the middle of the water. Ride it to the 
right, and jump back to land. Ride the log below that one to the left to reach 
the island with a chest and 999 COINS.

Ride back to the right, and ride the log above that one to the left. The chest 
here contains a WATER OF LIFE.

The next area of this room has six logs, three lining the bottom, and three 
lining the right side.

him the Muramasa.

Floor 10

Well, congratulations, you've finally made it to the bottom of the dungeon. A 
wrecked pirate ship lies rotting here. Check the chest in the middle of the 
deck to fight a Mimic. For defeating it, you get a POTION. If you need to 
desperately heal, use Cure, and walk around until your PP is restored. Just 
don't go near the north end of the ship! When you think that you're up for the 
biggest challenge in Golden Sun, head to the bow of the ship to enter a battle. 
I suggest putting all the Djinn back on their respective characters (default 
setup).

Boss Fight - Deadbeard
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recommended level: 26        
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the best things to remember while fighting Deadbeard is that the Djinn 
Flash and Ground can save you from a huge world of hurt. Use Flash the first 
round with Garet so that Deadbeard's attacks barely do any damage, and the next 
round, use Ground to negate one of his two attacks. While you're using Ground 
the second round, have Garet set Flash again, so that it's ready to use the 
next round. And then when you use Flash again, set Ground. See? This way, 
you'll only really get hurt every other round, and not really that much at 
that. Have Mia and Ivan attack with their Djinn, and then use their strongest 
summons. Heal with Mia when necessary. The battle will take a long time using 
this strategy, but it's definitely one of the easiest ways to win.

If you want to fail proof this strategy even further, give Issac all of the 
party's Psy Crystals and don't have Mia summon any Djinn. That way, she'll 
always be able to use the Wish psynergy, and Issac will be able to take a round 
off of attacking every once in a while to use a Psy Crystal on Mia. Of course, 
this also lengthens the battle even more. 

EXP   - 8000
COINS - 9000
ITEM  - WATER OF LIFE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the battle, check the chest at the front of the ship to get the DEMON 
MAIL. Equip this new piece of armor on Garet (or whoever has the Cleric's ring, 
as it's a cursed item).

WORLD MAP
---------

Return to the World map by walking up all the sets of stairs that you worked so 
hard to get down. The cyclone in the northwest corner will deposit you back 
outside of Suhalla. Enter the town and rest if you need it (and you most likely 
will). 

Okay, before we go rushing off to the end of the game, we need to make sure 
that we're ready. If you've already beaten Deadbeard, you're definitely ready 
for the finale. But there are some pieces of equipment that you can get that 
will make the final battles easier (and you'll be able to bring this good 
equipment to Golden Sun: The Lost Age). You should take the time to seek out 
some of these items. I'll point them out as the walkthrough draws to a close.

Do the following EXACTLY, or it won't work. Make sure that your characters are 
at least level 26 (Issac at 27), or else it won't work.  

Now, for the AURA GLOVES. Head to the exit that is closest to the Suhalla Gate. 
Save your game and reset. When you reload, exit and enter the desert seven 
times. In other words:

Exit, enter, exit, enter, exit, enter, exit, enter, exit, enter, exit, enter, 
exit, and enter. 

Now, the next battle you'll get into will be with a Vile Dirge and a Magicore. 
For the first round, you'll cast Psynergy. For all the attacks, AIM THE BIG 
ARROW at the Magicore. 
Cast Gaia with Issac 
Eruption with Garet 
Plasma with Ivan 
Wish with Mia 
This should kill the Vile Dirge
For the second round:
Defend with everyone except Mia
Have Mia attack with Sleet 
This should kill the Magicore, and net you the gloves.

(This method was made by Jairrame)

Equip the gloves on Ivan.

There's a bunch of items to be had from Lalivero, and a lot of the best items 
in the game can be purchased here. Head north to the statue in the middle of 
town first and grab the PSY CRYSTAL from the base. The Inn is right above the 
statue and a little to the left. The first room on the second floor has a 
barrel that contains a LUCKY MEDAL. To the right of the Inn is the Item Shop. A 
barrel in the back contains an ANTIDOTE. The shop south of the Item Shop is the 
Weapon and Armor shop. Check the house that's attached to the shop on the right 
side. There is a LUCKY MEDAL in a barrel here. Now enter the Weapon and Armor 
shop.

Climb up the ladder at the back of the shop to get to the roof. From here, you 
can jump across to the town wall, and follow it north. Follow it as far as you 
can, past the Mars Djinni, until you reach a rooftop with a single pot. From 
here, jump to the right to the other roof, and climb the vine to claim the Mars 
Djinni, Torch. Torch is another attack Djinni. Only one to go!

Back at the south end of town, head to the building in the bottom left corner. 
Climb the ladder in the back of this house, walk along the wall, and climb down 
the only vine on the wall to reach a chest with a WARRIOR'S HELM. It's a great 
piece of equipment, and you should equip it on Issac.

Okay, now we should hit the shops up for some of the best equipment in the 
game. First of all, buy the Mirrored Shield for Issac, and give Garet the War 
Gloves if Issac had them on. Buy the Jeweled Crown for Ivan and the Spirit 
Armlet and Magical Cassock for Mia. Buy a Knight's Helm for Garet. As for 
weapons, get the Silver Blade for Issac and the Crystal Rod for Mia.

Take the north exit out of town.

Getting to the chest in the first area is pretty straightforward. Climb up the 
first ladder to your right, and then climb down the other one. Climb up onto 
the ledge with the block, and push it to the left. Use Carry to move it up one 
space, and then left one space onto the ledge. Now jump across and get the 
LUCKY PEPPER from the chest. Use it on whoever has the highest luck in the 
party. Head north into the next area.

This is the main construction area, and the entrance to the lighthouse. There 
are two entrances into the lighthouse, and one of them leads right to the final 
Djinni. To the left of where you enter is a pillar next to a ladder leading 
into the ground. Head down and use Move on the closest pillar to move it one 
space to the left. Now head back up to the construction area, and head right. 
There is another pillar here. Move it to the side, and go down the ladder that 
is revealed. Move the remaining pillar to the left, and jump across. 

The ladder here leads to a sprout next to the wall of the lighthouse. Rearrange 
your Djinn if need be so that a character can use Growth. Use it on the plant 
here, and climb up. Slide down the notch in the wall, and enter the door. Now 
that you're inside the lighthouse, slide down the only notch in the floor that 
you can reach. This takes you directly to the Jupiter Djinni, Luff. Once you've 
defeated it, it will join you. That's it for Djinn! No more until Golden Sun 2.

Jump down the notch here. When you land, take the staircase in the upper left. 
Head up a couple of floors until you reach the room with the slides again. 
Slide down the one closest to the door you come out of, and you'll fall several 
stories into a basement room. Talk to the people here, and then use Reveal on 
the switch next to the door to prove to them that you're fit to enter. Then 
enter and head on in.

The walkthrough is going to assume that you listened to me earlier. The pattern 
on the floor when you enter this area should be the left path. If it isn't, 
skip ahead to the part of the walkthrough that deals with that path. 

The first room that you enter contains an extremely easy puzzle. If you can't 
figure it out by now, shame on you. Just move the blocks to create "stepping-
stones" to the other side of the room. The next room that you enter is the 
actual room that changes when you change the pattern on the floor. When you 
come back to take the right path, the stepping stones will lead you to the 
right. For now, head left.

This room isn't so bad either. Move the pillars so that you can jump onto them 
from the little outcropping, and reach the other side of the room. The next 
room is a little more complicated. Move the short pillars so you can jump onto 
the ledge to the left with all the ivy. Use Whirlwind to get rid of both 
patches of ivy, and reveal a pillar. Move it off the edge and onto the track on 
the floor. Now rearrange the new pillar and one of the old ones so that you can 
reach the door. Remove the ivy from it and enter.

Another easy puzzle. The balance set into the wall needs to be weighed down on 
the right side so that the left side rises. Use Carry to place two blocks on 
the right side. Ignore the extra block and jump across to the exit of the room. 
In the next room, head left first. 

This is a seemingly empty room (except for the statue in the center). Use 
Reveal on the statue to reveal a chest. Open it for an ORACLE'S ROBE. Equip it 
on Mia. Back in the previous room, head to the right.


Puzzle - Colored Statues

This puzzle actually had me stumped for a while, but once you know how to go 
about it, it's easy to solve. The main thing you need to know (and the thing I 
didn't know for a while) is that you can talk to the statues with the Mind Read 
psynergy. Each statue will provide a hint of where to place them in relation to 
the other statues. Here are the clues provided:

Yellow statue: Violet shines southeast of me.
Violet statue: Red shines northwest of me.
Red statue: Violet shines southeast of me.
Green statue: Yellow shines northeast of me.
Light blue statue: Red shines due west of me. 

The statues each go on one of those squares in the middle of the room. This is 
a fairly simple logic puzzle. If you can't figure it out, here's the 
explanation:

Violet is southeast of yellow and red, according to the clues. The only way 
this is possible is if it's in the southeast corner. This means that either 
yellow or red is in the middle. Since the red statue has to be due west of the 
light blue one, it must be on one of the outer squares (the northwest one), 
leaving yellow for the middle. The only space left is green, so the statues are 
configured as follows:

R B
 Y
G V 

This opens the door on the right side of the room. Enter, and then head up the 
steps to the Venus Lighthouse. Since we won't really be touring the lighthouse 
yet, I'm not going to make a separate section. For now, grab the Psynergy Stone 
if you need the healing, and head up the steps on the left side of the room. 
Push the statue here onto the switch, and use Reveal on the wall to enter the 
area where you can change the path inside the lighthouse. Since the electric 
barrier has risen again, you'll have to exit the lighthouse the traditional way 
and head back to Lalivero. From there, exit through the back of the town and 
enter the Tunnel Ruins again.

Or, as countless people have told me via email, just use the Retreat synergy
to return to the area before the electric barrier. 

We've already done the first puzzle room, which consisted of moving the blocks 
in place so that you could get across the room. Head through the next room (the 
stepping-stones lead to the right now). The first "puzzle" in the new room is 
just to push the pillar with water onto the mark in the floor. This raises a 
platform so you can cross the gap. The same puzzle lies in the south part of 
the room, except this time you need to use Douse on the pillar in order for the 
platform to rise. 

In the next room, take the stepping-stones east first. Another statue here will 
disappear after using Reveal, and this uncovers a chest that contains ASURA'S 
ARMOR. Equip this on Issac.

Back in the previous room, head south. This puzzle is a little tricky. First, 
use Move to get the pillar out of its niche. Push it into the other niche, 
climb back up the steps, use Douse on the pillar, and then use Frost on the 
puddle. Now you can jump across to the door to the south. Continuing south, 
you'll find yourself at the colored statue room. Go through the door here and 
go up the steps.

Okay, so you're back in the room with the Psynergy Stone. Before you do 
anything, there's a very powerful weapon you can get, right in this room. Yeah, 
it's another battle where you'll have to follow exactly what I'm saying, but 
here's how you do it:

1. Make sure that all of your Djinn are equipped on their default characters.

2. Make sure Garet's agility is above 150. If it isn't, give him someone else's 
Quick Boots. If that doesn't work, level up until he's ready. Also make sure 
that Mia goes before Garet, or else it won't work. You may have to give both 
characters Quick Boots.

3. Save your game in this room (the three doors and the Psynergy Stone).

4. Reset.

Okay, now you're all set. Reload your game and walk around until you get into a 
battle. It should be with a Fenrir and an Ice Gargoyle.

For the first round (aiming the big arrows at the Fenrir):
Clay Spire with Issac
Flare Wall with Garet
Cast Tornado with Ivan
Ice Horn with Mia
(NOTE: These psynergies are interchangeable with other spells that are similar. 
If you find that they are too weak or too strong, change the psynergy.)

For round two:
Defend with Issac
Unleash Torch with Garet at the Fenrir
(the Fenrir should die after the attack; again, Garet's agility should be above 
150, or the Fenrir will attack before Garet does, and you won't get the sword.)
Defend with Ivan
Cast Wish with Mia

For round three:
Unleash Bane with Issac to kill the Ice Gargoyle
Defend with everyone else

This should get you the Kikuichimonji, and a Potion to boot. This always works, 
I guarantee (that is, if you follow what I say EXACTLY).

Equip this sword on Ivan.

Now head through the center door of this room.

In this fairly large room, take the first door to the left. The room you enter 
has a simple pit that you can cross by using Carry on the block here. In the 
next room, skip the stairs, and head up and right to the sand flow. When you 
step onto it, hold right so that you can step off on the other side of the 
room. Head through the southern door first to reach a chest with a THUNDER 
CROWN. Since this is a cursed item, equip it on Garet. Head north and up the 
steps in the previous room. Walk through the third waterfall of sand to enter a 
new room.

Hop across the stones to the south part of this room. There's nothing much you 
can do here except enter the door to the south. Now you're faced with an 
introductory puzzle. You have to complete the circuit on the floor by pushing 
the correct blocks in the holes. There is only one block and one hole here, so 
it's not that hard to figure out. Completing the circuit opens the door. Step 
on the switch in the next room to obstruct the original sand flow and open 
another. Head out the door on the left side of this room.

You're back in the big room again, but the sand flow has changed. Climb down 
the ladder at the south end of the room, and then climb up the other one at the 
north. You can now use the sand flow to reach the door to the right. In the 
next room, climb down the ladder and move the left pillar so that you can get 
through the door. Push the other pillar in place, and use that to jump to the 
stairs to the north.

Climb down the ladder, head through the door, climb up the next ladder, and go 
up the steps. Go through the door to the south. Now you're at another circuit 
puzzle that looks like this:

  
 | |
 | |
 | |_______   ___C___   ____
 |  _______ 1 _______ 3 __  |__S
 | |       | | A   B | |  |__  |
 | |_______| |_______| |_____| |
 |_________ 2 _______ 4 _______|

S - Statue
# - Hole
A, B, C - Circuits

To complete, push pillar A into hole 3, pillar B into hole 4, and pillar C into 
hole 2.

In the next room, cross the sand flow, and jump to the area in the upper left 
corner. Take the southern doorway. Behind the first sand waterfall is a chest 
with some DRAGON SCALES. You may want to equip these on Issac, but I prefer 
Asura's Armor, since it boosts attack. Do what you feel is best.

Back out in the previous room, head through the second sand waterfall to reach 
a set of steps. Head on up. In this room, just use Carry to place the blocks on 
the left side of the balance. Now you can jump to the right side of this room 
and take the door to the south. Step on the switch here to create another sand 
flow, and jump across the gap to reach the stairs to the north (even though it 
doesn't look like you can jump across). Head down, and ride the sand flow to 
the lower left area of the room. Head up the steps here.

Enter the door to your right. Now you'll be in a room full of shifting sands. 
Pick your way to the chest in the bottom right (you can't fight the currents, 
but you can find currents that will take you where you need to be). The chest 
contains a GAIA BLADE. Equip this on Issac. Only one more weapon, and we have 
all the best equipment in the game! We'll get to that later, however. Exit this 
area in the upper right. Ignore the stones in the next room, and head through 
the door to the right.

S - Statue
# - Hole
A, B, C, D - Circuits

Place pillar A in hole 2, pillar B in hole 7, pillar C in hole 4, and pillar D 
in hole 6 to complete a circuit and open the door.

Step on the switch in the next room to create another sand flow. Jump across to 
the platform that just moved, and head down the stairs to the north. Exit 
through the door to emerge in the central sand flow. Follow the new one to the 
top right area of the room. Head up a few flights of stairs to a room with a 
Psynergy Stone. Don't jump on the slide! That leads to the end of the game. 
Before we go, we can get the last good weapon for Mia.

The only way I've ever gotten the Blessed Mace is by pyroclasmicinferno's 
method. To do this, you're going to have to return all the way to beginning of 
the lighthouse (the room with three doors and a Psy Crystal). Once here, head 
up the stairs to the left, and save and shut off the game. When you reload, 
return to the previous room. The first fight you'll get into will be against 
Willowisps and Recluses. Run from them, and get into another battle. This 
should be just a single Thunder Lizard.

First round:
Attack with Issac
Defend with Garet
Attack with Ivan
Defend with Mia

Second round:
Unleash Flint with Issac
Defend with everyone else

This will work every time, no matter what. If you can't kill the Thunder Lizard 
in these three attacks, you'll need to level up. Anyway, when you finally get 
it, equip it on Mia. Now you're ready for the final battle. Check your 
character's equipment, as it should look something like this, if you've been 
following the walkthrough.

Issac                         Garet
-----                         -----

Gaia Blade                    Muramasa
Warrior's Helm                Thunder Crown
Mirrored Shield               War Gloves

Mythril Shirt                 Running Shirt


Ivan                          Mia
----                          ---

Kikuichimonji                 Blessed Mace
Jeweled Crown                 Mythril Circlet
Aura Gloves                   Spirit Armlet
Storm Gear                    Oracle's Robe
Hyper Boots                   Quick Boots
War Ring                      War Ring
Mythril Shirt                 Mythril Shirt


There are some who would say that the Swift Sword is better for Ivan at higher 
levels, and there are some that would say that the Demon's Axe is better for 
Garet when he's a different class. These were just my suggestions. Do whatever 
you see fit.

In addition to all that, you should have these psynergy teaching items.

Catch Beads
Cloak Ball
Lifting Gem
Frost Jewel
Orb of Force
Carry Stone
Halt Gem
Douse Drop

You can also mess with the classes at this point, and get some really good 
results. One of the best combinations is the following:

Issac with one Venus Djinni and six Jupiter Djinni (Conjurer).
Garet with one Mars Djinni and six Venus Djinni (Berserker).
Ivan with one Jupiter Djinni and six Mercury Djinni (Sage).
Mia with one Mercury Djinni and six Mars Djinni (Water Monk).

Of course, you should arrange them so that they suit your playing style. 
Anyway, return to the top of the lighthouse if you opted to go back down for 
the Blessed Mace. This time, go down the slide and ride the platform to the top 
of the lighthouse.

After more chit-chat with Saturos and Menardi, you once again have to battle 
the pair. This time, it's kill or be killed, so give it all you've got.

Boss Fight - Saturos and Menardi
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recommended level: 30         
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This battle can easily be won by using the strategy presented in the Deadbeard 
battle (if you didn't fight Deadbeard, refer to that section of the walkthrough 
and read the strategy using the Ground and Flash Djinn). I find this strategy 
easiest when the party's Djinn are on their default characters. An alternate 
strategy is using Granite instead of Ground. Granite works like Flash, but not 
quite as well. Once one of them is dead, revert to using Ground again.

Otherwise, just keep your health up, use plenty of fourth level summons, and 
try to keep everyone alive (especially once the battle is drawing to a close). 
They're both weak against Mercury (water) attacks, so use that to your 
advantage (Boreas!!!!).

EXP   - 6000
COINS - 7800 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You didn't think you were getting off that easily, did you? There's one more 
fight before the end, and it strongly resembles your battle with Deadbeard.

Boss Fight - Fusion Dragon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recommended level: 31         
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another easy battle if you use the Flash-Ground/Flash-Granite tactic. Fusion 
Dragon gets two attacks per round, but Ground, Granite, and Flash will stop 
most of this damage from ever hitting. If you're using this tactic, keep 
summoning Boreas and Thor. If you find your life getting low, take a turn off 
with Mia to heal. The attack that will probably give you the most trouble is 
Outer Space. Despite the defensive Djinn, always try to keep everyone's HP 
above 140. If you've beaten Deadbeard, you'll have no problem with this battle.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, if you've beaten the Fusion Dragon, you've beaten the game! That's not 
the end of the story, however. The rest of the adventure unfolds in Golden Sun: 
The Lost Age. 

BONUS
-----

After the credits are over, you are asked if you want to save your adventure. 
The game will warn you that you can't load the data you're about to save. 
Remember this, and choose to save in a slot that you don't care about (i.e. an 
empty slot, or one you don't use). When the game starts over, and you see the 
title screen where it says "Press Start", hold Left on the control pad and the 
R shoulder button. Press start, and hold these buttons until the menu screen 
appears. There should be an option all the way to the right that's called Send. 
Select the data that you just saved, and choose Password (or link if you have 
two Game Boys). 

It asks you to choose from a Bronze, Silver, or Gold password. You'll want to 
keep all of your character's things into the next game, so just go with the 
(incredibly lengthy) Gold password. Write it down and input it when you play 
TLA.

In Golden Sun, different classes for different characters are obtained by 
trying different combinations of Djinn on the characters. Some classes are 
amazing, but by making one character a complete powerhouse, you're usually 
making another character weaker. You'll need to even out your party's power by 
spreading your Djinn wisely. Use this section to try out different 
combinations, and see what works best for you.

First off is a listing of all the classes and what benefits are brought to each 
character. When a character becomes a certain class by equipping the correct 
amount and combination of Djinn, he or she will experience an increase in his 
or her stats. The increase will be listed as a percentage. The character may 
also experience the addition or loss of psynergy, which will also be listed. 

HP - Hit Points (life)
PP - Psynergy Points
ATK - Attack
DEF - Defense
AGL - Agility
LCK - Luck

\ 8. Djinn /                                                             [djn2]
 '========'
~=============================================================================~

Well, here's the list of the Djinn in the game. As you probably know, Djinn are 
equipped onto your characters to raise their stats, change their classes, and 
give them more Psynergy. Djinn can be used in battle to attack, heal, or cause 
status ailments. They can also power up and become some pretty intense summon 
monsters. They're divided into their respective groups (Venus, Mars, Jupiter, 
Mercury), and following the name of the Djinn will be the description of what 
it does in battle, and what stats it raises when set to a character (ignoring 
any class changes). 

HP - Hit Points (life)
PP - Psynergy Points
ATK - Attack
DEF - Defense
AGL - Agility
LCK - Luck

The reason I didn't put numerical values for each stat is because the stat gain 
actually varies depending on how many other Djinn are equipped on a character. 
It would be quite a task to list them all. On the other hand, just listing the 
stat gains if it's the only Djinni equipped to a character is pretty pointless, 
so I won't do that either.

Also included is information on stronger summons and where you can find each 
Djinni.


Venus Djinn are Issac's default Djinn, and are innately connected with the 
Earth element.

In Golden Sun, you'll run across weapons in three different ways: You can find 
them in chests, buy them from shops, or get them when you defeat an enemy. 
Always remember to keep checking your character's equipment to see if you can 
upgrade any of it.

The following lists are sorted by weapon types (along with who can use them), 
and after the name of each is the attack power of the weapon (ATK), the price 
that you can buy the weapon at (selling price is 75% of this amount), and the 
location of the weapon along with special notes.

\ 10. Armor /                                                            [armr]

In Golden Sun, you'll run across armor in three different ways: You can find 
them in chests, buy them from shops, or get them when you defeat an enemy. 
Always remember to keep checking your character's equipment to see if you can 
upgrade any of it.

The following lists are sorted by armor types (along with who can use them), 
and after the name of each is the defense power of the armor (DEF), the price 
that you can buy the armor at (selling price is 75% of this amount), and the 
location of the armor along with special notes. Don't ask me why I organized 
them like I did... I don't know either.

You'll find equipment in Golden Sun far and in between. For the most part, 
you'll be dealing with equipment that you'll get during the story that teaches 
you Psynergy vital to completing the game. Some, however are optional and 
rather hard to come across. 

You'll also find rings to put on your characters. They don't do much when 
equipped, but when used as an item they can help out a bit. All rings have a 
chance of breaking when used.
