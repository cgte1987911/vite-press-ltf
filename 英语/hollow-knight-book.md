1. It would seem you've happened upon my journal. This volume contains a record of my observations and musings, transcribed as I travelled into the kingdom's depths and-through a miracle of either luck or sheer willpower-returned safely to the surface.

   看来，你偶然发现了我的日记。这本书记载了我的观察与沉思，是我当年深入王国腹地——后又凭运气或纯粹意志力的奇迹安然返回地表——时所记录下来的。

2. My travels brought me to Hallownest purely out of curiosity; though I expected to find naught but a desolate ruin down below, what awaited me was quite possibly the adventure of a lifetime.

   我的旅程纯粹是出于好奇而将我带至圣巢；尽管我本以为在地下只会找到一片荒凉的废墟，但等待着我的，却很可能是一场一生难遇的冒险。
