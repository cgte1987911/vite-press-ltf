===========================================================================
Version Updates
===========================================================================

30 December 2005:
 Started with this Walkthrough, Completed Prologue.

Version 0.1
2 January 2006:
 Completed the game up to Yampi Desert

Version 0.2
4 January 2006:
 Completed Air's Rock and the events in Alhafra, incorporated the items 
from "the Lost Age" into the tables taken from my GS(1) walkthrough.

Version 0.3
12 May 2006:
 Completed the game up to chapter 7.

Version 0.4
15 July 2006:
 Completed the game up to the point where you have to go to Hesperia.

Version 0.6
25 July 2006:
 Reached the Mars Lighthouse, only few steps away of completing the game.

Version 0.7
26 July 2006:
 Finished all the regular dungeons in the game. I still need to complete 
the optional dungeons: Anemos Inner Sanctum, Islet Cave and Yampi Desert 
Cave.

Version 0.71
28 July 2006:
 Checked most parts of the walkthrough for errors.

Version 0.8
30 July 2006:
 Completed all the optional dungeons and got all Items/Summon/Djinn. Now I 
can start compiling the appendices.

Version 0.9
 2 August 2006:
 Filled in most of tables in the appendices. Found out about the statistic 
increases in the base classes, therefore revised all the tables for this 
game & GS1. Started with counting chests & hidden items; I currently found 
258 of them.

Version 0.95
 6 August 2006:
 I finally managed to complete ALL of the tables, although the Psynergy 
table is a bit messy at this moment. Added a glitch to the stuff section; 
Sheba speaking about meeting werewolves whereas she never met them! Reused 
and updated most of the GS1 information so it fits this game.

Version 0.97
 7 August 2006:
 Did some additional checks and cleared up some of the lay-out. Added some 
details about the linked event in Alhafra considering Deadbeard.

Version 1.0
 8 August 2006:
 Counted and made totals for the number of items and chests, just like in 
the walkthrough for GS. Added some additional details here and there, also 
made some lay-out changes to make it more uniform with the corresponding 
GS1 Walkthrough.

Version 1.1
 14 August 2006:
 Included a THE easiest 2 Round Strategy that allows you to beat Dullahan 
on Normal and even on Hard Mode and it works like a charm (read it never 
fails!). Also added a good strategy for beating all three heads of Doom 
Dragon in 4 Rounds as well. Updated some other parts as well, but that is 
just minor. Added descriptions for the Slot machine and Dice games in 
Contigo as well.

Version 1.2
 27 August 2006:
 Added some information about the mistranslation of Hsu; Feizhi calls him 
Ulmuch in this game. Also corrected some of the artifacts in the chart 
tables. Finally, I managed to find the missing GS1 Djinni's location for 
the people who get less than 7 Jupiter Djinn from Isaac's team. He's 
located at the edge of the western hemisphere: SW Atteka Islet. Added a 
realistic password for those of you who wish to transfer all the important 
stuff, but not the game spoiling overpowered statistics.

Version 1.3
 28 September 2006:
 I updated the password section and altered the Maximum password, because I 
figured out a way to include the GS2 items. These are oh-so much more 
powerful than the GS1 weapons. Second I also included a Collector password 
which included about every single artifact that is not obtainable in GS2 
(it even includesw the Ninja Sandals and other Dummied Out item).

Version 1.35
 23 November 2006:
 Found four more items in the game; three in the Ankohl Ruins and 1 in 
Air's Rock. I also fixed some of the left/right directional mistakes, but 
there are unfortunately more of them. These will be corrected on the next 
update.

Version 1.4
 29 December 2006:
 Added some information about the RNG methods and strategies in this game. 
They can be found in Appendix F under the Stuff section. Most strategies 
are similar to the ones in GS1, but the are some twists here and there 
rendering the "5x Perfect Bonus" strat for the Lucky Dice useless. Apart 
from that I included the 6th event which is supposed to be linked with GS1. 
It is the conversation with Dora, when she is ill. Unfortunately, I didn't 
find anything in GS2 that could link to that event.

Version 1.5
 27 February 2007:
 Included the Trial Road duplication glitch for infinite amounts of 
Tomegathericons and such. :) Removed the Nut from Lemuria's hidden item 
list as it was just a random item found with "Scoop". Both discoveries are 
from Jeffrey Ng, so the credits go to him.
 Furthermore I explained a method for getting infinite Game Tickets by 
using "Scoop" in the Stuff section.

Version 1.6
 17 March 2007:
 Fixed some mistakes thanks to Jeffrey Ng and added a secret method to 
set/standby all Djinn in one go (just press Select while holding R)! 
Furthermore he provided a strategy to get the Excalibur with much better 
chance. Also added some video links to youtube.com showing the battles 
against Dullahan and Doom Dragon as suggested in the FAQ.
 Also added some video links to youtube showing the Dullahan and Doom 
Dragon strategies in their full glory! I even modified the Doom Dragon 
strategy a bit to make it even possible to slay the dragon in three
turns.

Version 1.7
 18 June 2007:
 Found some problems such as the issues with the Linkage systems using GBA
SPs by Chris Maka, the bug of getting stuck in Lemuria by Matthew Casler 
and several other things. Apart from that I've included the RNG strategy
for the Tisiphone Edge created by Timon Sears. Thank you all for your 
contributions.

Version 1.75
 20 November 2007:
 Fixed some errors in the walkthrough and included the fourth requirement
that is required to make the RNG strategies for item drops work. It also
includes a new glitch in the Ankohl Ruins.

Version 1.8
 22 March 2009:
 After some delays all the feedback I received from everybody has been
processed. Thank you all for your response! Don't hesistate on sending in
any missing / new info or other improvements This FAQ won't die for
quite some time. ^_^
 The Gabomba tile puzzle turned out to be random and therefore some people
where unable to get through it with the description in this game. This
has been fixed now.

Version 1.85
 8 August 2010:
 Update after some mails includes a few glitches and stuff like that. One
glitch about jumping over a rock as if it was a water puddle and some more
notes on the Lucky wheel.

Version 1.9:
28 April 2013:
 Found a missing enemy: Conch Shell, updated several boss strategies and
reformatted several parts in the guide. Added and simplified several boss
strategies (such as Doom Dragon & Star Magician).



===========================================================================
Frequently Asked Questions
===========================================================================


Q: Is it Djinn or Djinni?
A: Actually both; you see Djinn is plural for Djinni. 'A single Djinni or
   several Djinn'. That is the question.


Q: How can I use "Growth" Psynergy?
A: The answer to this is pretty simple: You need to have an adept in of the
   right class in other to use Growth. Equip a Mars Djinni to Felix or a
   Venus Djinni to Jenna and either one will be capable of using "Growth". 
   Also make sure to remove those special class items as they otherwise
   prevent class transitions.


Q: How can I use Whirlwind Psynergy? Sheba can't use it anymore.
A: Put all of Sheba's Djinn on stand-by and he can use Whirlwind again, 
   this is caused by the class differences, similar to the previous 
   question. Take note that Felix and Jenna can use "Gale" as a substitute 
   in their Ninja class for "Whirlwind". Also make sure to remove those 
   special class items as they otherwis prevent class transitions.


Q: I can't get over the sand/water streams. The currents are too strong!
A: Use the 'B' button to make Felix run. While running diagonally against
   the current and into the direction you want, you can reach the other
   side without falling down.
 

Q: Which Djinn/Class combination is the best to use?
A: For most of the game where you have only few Djinn you can best stick to
   the standard and default combination:

      Venus Adepts   (Isaac / Felix): All Venus Djinn
      Mars Adepts    (Garet / Jenna): All Mars Djinn
      Jupiter Adepts (Ivan  / Sheba): All Jupiter Djinn
      Mercury Adepts (Mia   / Piers): All Mercury Djinn

   This party is strong and you can use many Djinn and Summons without
   getting any severe downgrades. After you obtain all 9 Djinn of each type
   you may want to switch to a combination of different Djinn like:

      Venus Adepts:   5 Mercury + 4 Mars     => Paladin
      Mars Adepts:    5 Venus   + 4 Jupiter  => Ronin
      Jupiter Adepts: 4 Mercury + 5 Mars     => Warlock
      Mercury Adepts: 4 Venus   + 5 Jupiter  => Pure Mage

   Statistically speaking this is the best balanced and most powerful
   overall combination, with very powerful mixed Psynergies. However if you
   use many Djinn the downgrades become really terrible, because these
   super classes degrade to regular classes.

   Also take note how the Djinn are distributed among the characters, you
   can see that the Venus Adept (who is strong to Earth and weak to Wind)
   only has Mars & Mercury Djinn. The same applies to the others. You may
   want to check the Appendices for more information about Classes and
   Djinn assignments. Also beware that the mixed setup makes it in some
   cases more difficult to get Djinn Kills. See Appendix F under Djinn Kill
   for more information about this matter.


Q: Those stupid monsters won't give me the required item drop I want!
A: Look at the bottom of the FAQ under the Stuff section. There I will
   explain the tactic of abusing the random number generator of this game
   in such a way that you can get any(!) rare item drop with 100%
   guarantee.


Q: Is there a way to put all your Djinn on standby more easily? It is too
   tedious to do it one-by-one.
A: Well, yes there is actually. Press and hold the "R" button in the Djinn
   selection screen. Then tap 'select' to set or release all Djinn in one
   go. No more sore hands! ;) Why this trick wasn't included in the manual
   eludes me...


Q: I missed the Tremor Bit in Madra and I am in Alhafra now. The bridge
   is broken and I can't return to Madra to get it. What now?
A: Yes, the bridge is broken, but it should be possible to retrace your 
   steps to Madra. Go via the Yampi Desert to the Western shore and there
   should be a location on the map where you can walk back to the previous 
   continent. The hike may be a long one, but you can get back at this
   point.
   However, if you do this after passing by the initial trip to Madra the
   cave entrance will be blocked off. You'll need "Reveal" psynergy first
   to get through the catacombs via the other entrance!





===========================================================================
Controls
===========================================================================

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Controller
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

D-Pad
------------
 Walk around on the map with your leading character. Take note that you can 
walk diagonally in this game too! It is also used to select different 
options if those are available (you know, the usual).

Start
------------
 Start the game or in the Field display the Pause Menu 

Select
------------
 Use it in the field to display Field Commands Menu. Or in the Djinn 
selection screen hold R then press Select to put ALL Djinn on set or 
standby in one go.

A Button
------------
 Use it to confirm an attack or command. Also used to talk to people 
in villages, open chests and pick up items when you examine objects. 

B Button
------------
 Most often the opposite of the A button: Cancel an attack or command. In 
the field used to run. This can be very handy so use this option well! 
Later on when your ship gets wings you fly on the world map using this 
button.

Top L Button
------------
 Use a direct Psynergy Link attached to the L button in the Psynergy menu. 
Useful if you need to use a certain Psynergy often like Reveal or Move. On 
the map you can use this to zoom out a little, so you can see where you 
headed towards. Inside a battle this can be used to view your statistics 
and settings for a certain character.

Top R Button
------------
 Same as L button, but for another Psynergy you can select independently 
from the L button. On the world map you can use this to bring the entire 
world map on-screen. Inside a battle this can be used to view your 
statistics and settings for a certain character.
In the Djinn selection screen hold R then press Select to put ALL Djinn on 
set or standby in one go.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Game Selection / Start Menu
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This dynamic menu appears when you start up the Golden Sun Game Pack. 
After you press 'start' at the Title Screen (or right away when it is the 
first time you start the game). There are several options here that may 
change depending on what you can do, at that moment. There are 3 save files 
in total. Here are is a brief summary of all the options:

New Game (Light flash from a jar)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 This does simply what it says. You start a new game, beginning at the 
prologue. You do need to insert a name for your leading hero. Felix is the 
default name and that is the reference name I will stick to as well. This 
option only appears if you have at least one empty file. If you also have a 
"Clear Data" file saved, then you can even choose a difficulty setting 
(Easy, Normal or Hard). See the beginning of the walkthrough for more 
information about this.

Copy (Two papers; one is purple)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 Indeed it copies a game save from one slot to another, however if you have 
2 empty slots you cannot determine to which slot it gets saved though. This 
appears only if you have 1 or more empty file.

Erase (A paper with a piece of gum on it)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 This erases the selected game from the memory permanently. So be careful 
when using this option. It only appears if you have at least one saved 
game.

Continue (Some stairs)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 With this you can continue on where you left off the last time you saved. 
It appears of course only if you have any saved games. If you have a 
damaged save file than you may start from the last sanctum that you 
visited. But beware that it might be possible that some items are lost, 
that may cause you to get stuck. Use this option if there is no other way 
to retrieve the data.

Battle (Two people facing each other)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 This brings you to the battle arena, which is actually a mini-game that 
can be played for fun against a random enemy or you can also compete 
against a friend in a Linked Battle (Check out the Battle Arena Section 
below for more information). Your characters (Djinn, Items, Psynergy, 
Statistics and Configuration) are read from one of the game files before 
you enter the arena. Any alternations are NOT remembered, this means that 
if you use an item in the Battle Arena and you continue on the regular game 
with the same file the item will still be there. This option appears just 
like continue, erase and copy when at least one Game Save is present, but 
only after you obtain your first Djinni.

Update (Bright yellow flash)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 The last option that can be displayed in GS:tLA's Start Menu is the Update 
option. With this you can transfer data from the original GS to GS: the 
Lost Age. Check out Appendix F for more information about this Linkage 
system and how to make the best use of this option. It will not appear if 
all game saves are only "Empty" or "Post Reunion" data.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pause Menu
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 While playing the game you can press Start on the field screen in order to 
bring a small menu up. Here you can do three things, save the game on one 
of the game slots, put the game in sleep mode so you consume less battery 
power (if you don't want to switch it off yet) and finally can change the 
appearance of the window if you like too. Next to the screen color the 
configuration also allows you to increase the speed of the text messages 
and mute the characters voices if you find them too irritating. Personally 
I like the default blue or one of the lighter greenish tones. In this game 
you can also adjust the speech rate so the game put it on 'Fast' right away 
to save you some time!



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Field Commands Menu
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 During regular game play you can enter this menu, when you are in the 
field. Sometimes the Field Commands Menu appears instantaneously if you 
examine a peculiar object. This usually hints you that you need to use a 
specific object from the Inventory. There are several options you can 
choose between.

Psynergy (figure with a whirl of energy)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 Select this to get the menu for Psynergy in which you see and use the 
Psynergy for each character. Some of the Psynergies can do healing while 
others like Move and Lift can be used in the field. Just select them and 
press 'A' to use them right away.
 You can also assign a shortcut to 2 Psynergies as well. Stand on the 
desired Psynergy and press either L or R button to highlight that Psynergy, 
and press 'A' to confirm that you want to assign that Field Psynergy to the 
desired button. This way you can use it a lot easier than having to open 
the entire menu time after time.


Djinn (Venus Djinni)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 The Djinn Options may seem a bit complicated at first, but it is not that 
bad. If you have some trouble however understanding the information about 
the Djinn you can always press 'Select' in this menu to see additional Help 
data on this subject. Also when you meet your first Djinni he will also do 
some explaining on how to use Djinn properly. Therefore I will keep my 
explanation here rather short. A Djinni can be in either one of the 
following 3 statuses: Set (white text), Stand-by (red) and Recovery 
(yellow).

 Normally a Djinni is on Set which means you can use him in battle; this 
can be changed into Stand-by by pressing either Top L or Top R button. The 
color of the Djinni's name will turn into a red color to mark it on "Set". 
If a Djinni is set he can be unleashed in a Summon (or it can be set again 
using the Set command) this does more damage than a regular attack. After 
this happens all Djinn used in the Summon will be assigned to the Recovery 
status. 

 In Recovery a Djinni can't do anything other than waiting to recover to 
the 'Stand-by' status. This happens when you walk around in the field or 
when you go through the next round in combat, 1 Djinn per turn can be 
recovered this way until all Djinn are back in Stand-by again.

 When a Djinni is in Stand-by or Set mode, they can be assigned to other 
party members as well. Just select the Djinn with 'A' to highlight it and 
move it to the desired party member. Of course you can't assign all Djinn 
to one member so they can only have even amount of Djinn in which case you 
can only Trade it. In the other case one character may have 1 Djinn more 
than the other so you can also Give a Djinni next to trading it.


Item (An opened Chest)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 This opens the inventory screen where you can see all the items in your 
possession. A thing I didn't like about the inventory setup is that it is 
chopped up in 4 parts of 15 items; one for each hero instead of one big 
jumble. Later on when Isaac joins you get some more leisure as your 
inventory increase to 8 * 15.

 This means that in some cases you will have multiple copies of items 
roaming over the place. It can be quite annoying sometimes when you want to 
equip armor to someone whose inventory is already full, meaning that you 
have to swap items usually more than once. Luckily most common items can be 
stacked meaning that 1 character can carry up to 30 of the same kind in one 
space. As displayed you can use the L+A buttons to arrange all items by the 
default order, the other visible option is the R button which shows you the 
current equipment for that character.

 When you just entered this menu, you can select the inventory of the hero 
you need by pressing right and left. If you found the required item press A 
so you can select that item with the cursor. After doing so some info about 
that object appears at the bottom of the screen and you can see six options 
of which some may be grayed out.

 Option   What it does
 -------- -------------------------------------------------------------
 Use      Allows you to use that item
 Give     Give the item to another character
 Equip    This only works on weapons and armors of course
 Remove   Unequip the weapon/armor if it was equipped initially
 Details  See additional detailed information of that item
 Drop     Throw the item away permanently. Use this to make room in the
          Inventory if you really need to, else I'd recommend to sell
          as much stuff as possible.


Status (Three papers)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
In here you can rearrange your party format if you like. Just press L and R 
to move the individual characters from left to right moving them next to 
the other characters. If you press 'A' when you select a hero his/her data 
will appear in the screen below it.
 There are three different Status Screens on display, starting with the 
Detailed Statistics Screen. Here you can see the Class, Ailment Status, all 
statistics and the current Djinni for that person (The statistics are 
described in the next section).
 Press 'A' again to see the next screen with a list of all available 
Psynergies for that person. Here you can see all the Psynergy spells that 
person can use. For each spell there are five things to see here (from left 
to right): Icon, Name, Psynergy Point Cost, Type and its Range.

For the types we have:

    Color    Type (Kind)      
    -------- -------------------
    Yellow   Venus   = Earth
    Red      Mars    = Fire
    Blue     Mercury = Water
    Purple   Jupiter = Wind
    -------- -------------------

The following possible icons for the range are displayed:

 Image      No. of Targets        Additional information
 --------   -------------------   -----------------------------
     |      One Target            -
    .|.     Up to Three Targets   Center Target has most effect
   .|||.    Up to Five Targets    Center Target has most effect
  .|||||.   Up to Seven Targets   Center Target has most effect
  |||||||   All targets           All Targets have equal effect
 --------------------------------------------------------------

The last page displayed the current items in the inventory of you 
character. Take note that you can also see the Elemental properties of some 
of the weapons. For example the Gaia Blade has a Yellow dot next to it if 
you display it here. This means that it is a Venus elemental weapon, hence 
it causes more damage to enemies weak to this element!!!


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Statistics
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Like most RPGs the characters in Golden Sun have statistics that increase 
by leveling up and equipping weapons and armors. Here's a brief summary of 
kind of statistics used in GS.

LV - Level
- - - - - -
 This is overall strength of a character measured on a scale from 1 to 99. 
Each time you gain enough Experience by battling enemies you go up one 
level and all your statistics are increased a bit. Sometimes you will also 
receive a message about a new Psynergy that is learned.


Exp - Experience
- - - - - - - - -
 As mentioned about in the description for level, experience is used for 
becoming stronger. The first weak enemies you encounter will only drop 5 
Exp, but later on these numbers will increase quite a lot (e.g. 
Wonderbird). Take note that the amount of experience you get from an enemy 
can be enhanced by killing an enemy with a Djinn Unleash of the element of 
the type to which that enemy is weak. For example a Sky Dragon is weak 
against Wind. If you unleash a Jupiter Djinni against it, it will do more 
damage and if it kills the Sky Dragon it will give 133% Experience & Gold 
(the chance for item drop quadruples too).


HP - Health Points
- - - - - - - - - -
 This number represents how much damage a character can take. If this meter 
reaches 0 that person gets downed. If all party members are downed you lose 
the game and have to start over at either the last sanctum or the last save 
point (you are however allowed to save the data up to that moment though). 
So always try to keep these numbers as high as possible using healing 
spells and/or items. This number can also be increased by eating a Power 
Bread.


PP - Psynergy Points
- - - - - - - - - - -
 Using Psynergy requires energy, and so we have the Psynergy Points which 
show how much Psynergy a character can use. Each time you use such a spell 
this meter gets drained a bit. Take note that Psynergy is slowly regained 
by walking around in the field. Similar to HP, PP can be increased if your 
character eats a Cookie.


ATK - Attack
- - - - - - -
 This number simply displays how strong your character is physically. The 
higher this number the more damage direct weapon attacks will cause. It can 
be increased permanently by devouring an Apple and temporarily in battle by 
using Psynergy spells like "Impact", "Angel Spear" and others.


DEF - Defense
- - - - - - -
 The amount of defense determines how much damage you take from direct 
enemy attacks. Of course the higher this number the stronger you are 
against enemy attacks and the less damage you receive. It can be increased 
permanently by using a Hard Nut on your character. In battle you can use 
Psynergies like "Protect" and "Guardian". Note that an attack in this 
battle system will always do at least 1 point damage.


AGL - Agility
- - - - - - -
 Agility appears to have only one function in battle; it determines who 
will strike first in a turn. The higher this number is the earlier you can 
attack, Ivan (Wind Elemental) is very fast and is usually always the first 
character that may launch initial attack. By eating Mint a character can 
gain a few points permanently and by using Djinn like Zephyr in battle you 
can temporarily raise Agility as well.


LCK - Luck
- - - - - -
 The final statistic used in this game is Luck. It's a bit hard to tell 
what luck does exactly, but according to the manual the higher this number 
the stronger you will become against special attacks and the smaller the 
chance is that you will be affected by an Ailment. Luck is the only 
statistic that cannot be increased by Psynergies, Leveling up or Djinn 
Unleashes. The only thing you can do is using Lucky Pepper on a character 
to increase it by 2 points or setting some of the Djinn may also increase 
it by 1 or 2 points. Also some of the stronger and rare armors seem to 
affect luck as well.


Elemental Power / Resistance
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 Finally there is the elemental power and resistance that each character 
has. The initial setup for each character is by default:

 Property  | Felix | Jenna | Sheba | Piers
           | Isaac | Garet | Ivan  | Mia
 -------------------------------------------
 Strong    | Earth | Fire  | Wind  | Water
 Weak      | Wind  | Water | Earth | Fire

 As you can see the main characters are all strong against one element (the 
element of their own type) and weak to the opposite element. By setting the 
proper Djinn to the four characters this may change into a different 
setting. For example: if we give Sheba a few Venus Djinn she will become 
strong against Earth, but not necessarily weak against wind. It depends on 
the values of the other elements too! Check the Status Screen to see these 
values.

 For all Elemental Powers and Resistances the maximum limit is the value of 
200. The type with the highest value for Resistance is the type against 
which the ally is strong against, the lowest value is the type against 
which the character is weak. Some equipment (especially later on) can 
dramatically change these values. So it would be wise to look at the 
elemental properties of the armors too, instead of only looking at which 
armor has the highest Defense value.

 The same default rule applies to the Power values, e.g. Piers can do more 
damage with water elemental attacks (be it Psynergy, Djinn Unleash or 
Summon) and less with fire elemental attacks. Once again these numbers can 
be changed as well by setting the right Djinn / equipping items to your 
characters. 



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ailments
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Here I'll describe the main ailments that are used in this game. An 
ailments is a special status that can be caused by an enemy attack like 
poison or things like that. Most of the ailments are quite annoying, so try 
to prevent them as much as possible.

- - - -
Poison
- - - -
 The Poison status is often induced by enemy attacks, which cause your 
character to take about 5 to 10% of Maximum HP damage each following round 
until he/she is downed or purged. The damage is luckily only little so you 
may last several rounds without too much injury. Poison also remains active 
after you leave a battle, if you walk around in the field with a poisoned 
character it will take damage too. So do be careful with this in the long 
term. In battle a character will have little green skull floating next to 
him/her denoting this status. Here are some cures:

 Antidote     - This item will remove poison for one character
 Cure Poison  - The Mercury Psynergy will work on one ally costing 2 PP
 Unicorn Ring - Using this item removes Poison
 Tonic/Salt   - These Djinn can cure nearly anything for the entire party
 Sanctum      - In a sanctum you can also cure poison for some gold
 Die & Revive - Not my favorite method, but it does work

- - - -
Venom
- - - -
 Similar to Poison, but this Ailment does a lot more damage, usually like 
20% of the Maximum HP. It doesn't occur that often, but it is lethal 
nonetheless. If you get hit by this you will receive a message that you've 
been struck with Deadly Poison and it is denoted by little red skull 
floating over the infected person. Like I said Venom is nearly the same as 
Poison so the same healing tactics apply:

 Antidote     - This item will remove poison for one character
 Cure Poison  - The Mercury Psynergy will work on one ally costing 2 PP
 Unicorn Ring - Using this item in battle removes Poison
 Tonic/Salt   - These Djinn can cure nearly anything for the entire party
 Sanctum      - In a sanctum you can also cure poison for some gold
 Die & Revive - Not my favorite method, but it does work

- - - - -
Delusion
- - - - -
 A character that is deluded has a higher chance of missing its opponent, 
although I haven't seen a real significant increase in miss rates it may be 
annoying sometimes.  

 Elixir       - This item will cure Delusion for one character
 Fairy Ring   - Use this ring in battle works like an elixir
 Restore      - Again a Mercury Psynergy will work for 2 PP
 Luck         - Sometimes a character can regain its sight by itself
 Tonic/Salt   - These Djinn can cure nearly anything for the entire party
 Die & Revive - Not necessary since this status isn't that bad all the same
 Battle End   - After you finish a battle this status will vanish

- - - -
Sleep
- - - -
 Some attacked can make a character fall in a vast sleep so they won't be 
able to fight. Its effect is similar to sting since it has the same 
property. Sleep is denoted by some "zZz" marks over the character's head.

 Elixir       - This item will cure Sleep for one character
 Fairy Ring   - Use this ring in battle works like an elixir
 Restore      - A versatile Psynergy will do the job for 2 PP
 Luck         - Sometimes a character awakens from slumber just like that
 Tonic/Salt   - These Djinn can cure nearly anything for the entire party
 Die & Revive - Not necessary since this status isn't that bad all the same
 Battle End   - After you finish a battle this status will vanish

- - - -
Sting
- - - -
 Odd, why they have two different statuses for one and the same effect... 
At least the effect is identical to Sleep. Regaining from this status is 
exactly the same to the previous status as well. If an ally is hit by this 
you can see some yellow angular lines next to that person.

 Elixir       - This item will cure Sleep for one character
 Fairy Ring   - Use this ring in battle works like an elixir
 Restore      - A versatile Psynergy will do the job for 2 PP
 Luck         - Sometimes a character awakens from slumber just like that
 Tonic/Salt   - These Djinn can cure nearly anything for the entire party
 Die & Revive - Not necessary since this status isn't that bad all the same
 Battle End   - After you finish a battle this status will vanish

- - - -
Haunt
- - - -
 This is a bit similar to poison, since it can cause somewhat damage. The 
big difference is that it doesn't do damage every single round, it only 
happens randomly. Also this ailment can't be cured with conventional ways 
and above all this ailment doesn't go away after the battle ends.

 Tonic/Salt   - These Djinn can cure nearly anything for the entire party
 Die & Revive - It does get rid of the ghost...
 Sanctum      - In a sanctum you can also cure haunted people for some gold

- - - -
Downed
- - - -
 Of all the status ailments this is naturally the worst since it causes a 
character to fall down and disabling him or her permanently. This happens 
when either the spirit gets drained (instant kill) or if his/her HP reaches 
0. In most RPGs death isn't considered as an ailment, but in GS the game 
clearly refers to it as Downed hence I included it here in this list. You 
cannot heal a character in order to undo this status, but you may revive a 
character using the following:

 Quartz, Dew,
 Spark & Tinder - These 4 Djinn can revive (doesn't always work)
 Revive         - The Venus "Revive" Psynergy can cure this status
 Water of Life  - Revives and fills all HP
 Sanctum        - The spiritual can revive in exchange for some gold

- - - - - - -
Sylphon Seal
- - - - - - -
 This ailment is also known as the more common 'Silence' Ailment, which 
causes magic spells to be blocked. This means that your character can no 
longer use Psynergy attacks. It is denoted by a rotating Purple Seal next 
to the affected character. Unlike the other ailments this one can affect 
bosses as well.

 Luck         - A character may regain Psynergy abilities automatically
 Tonic/Salt   - These Djinn can cure nearly anything for the entire party
 Die & Revive - Not necessary since this status isn't that bad all the same
 Battle End   - Once the battle is over the seal is gone

- - - - - - - - - - - - -
'Predict Downed' / Curse
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
 I don't know anymore how this status is called in battle, but it appears 
when you get hit by an attack with a candle burning over your character. If 
it connects you will see 3 big flames and 1 small flame. Each turn a flame 
is extinguished (big flame is 2 turns), and if all flames are gone the Grim 
Reaper appears to deliver the fatal blow, causing Instant Death.

 Elixir       - According to the game description this should work
 Restore      - This will Dispel Grim Reaper
 Die & Revive - That would be silly in this case
 Battle End   - Quickly end the battle and the bad omen is lifted

- - - -
Cursed
- - - -
 The last status I will note here is the Cursed status. This status only 
appears later on in the game when you find and equip your first cursed 
weapon / armor. Cursed weapons are usually quite strong, yet they have the 
annoying ability to paralyze the character in rounds 2, 5 and 7 (and more) 
of a battle when he/she is using it.
 Also once you equip a cursed weapon you can't take it off anymore, which 
means that you are stuck to it. This status is attached to the item and 
even though a Sanctum can remove the cursed item from your equipped slot it 
doesn't dissolve the curse on the item itself. Therefore the cursed item 
will always remain cursed.
 There is of course one way to prevent the paralysis; by equipping a 
Cleric's Ring you can use the weapon / armor without the effect of getting 
paralyzed randomly. However this still doesn't remove the curse from the 
item. So the only way to unequip an item that causes this is by going to 
the Sanctum.

 Sanctum       - Removes the item from your equipped slot, but not from
                 the item itself (it remains cursed).
 Cleric's Ring - Cancels the paralysis effect out, but does not remove
                 the cursed item for a character.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Combat System
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The battle system of both Golden Sun games is a 'Turn based' battle 
system, in which a good strategy is essential, rather than good timing at 
pressing buttons. Battles in GS:tLA are almost always random encounter, 
with the exception of certain events and bosses. All Dungeons/Tower/Caves 
and the World Map have an infinite supply of enemies in store for you, the 
random encounter rate is in my opinion a bit high at some parts of the 
game. This is annoying especially if you're trying to solve a big puzzle. 
There may be many battles, but it is not that bad as Tales of Phantasia 
however which happens to be master of random battles by far to my knowledge 
(that game is still nice though).

 Anyway, when you walk around in the field you may have a chance to 
encounter a random battle against 1 to 5 enemies at most. You'll hear an 
enemy growl and the screen flashes to let you know a battle is about to 
commence. Your characters get warped to the battle arena where they are 
standing next to each other opposite of the enemies. At the start of each 
turn there will be 3 options you can choose between:


Battle Options
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fight (Figure with a sword)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 If you choose this you can select which attacks you want to use on your 
enemy. See below for more information about these battle tactics.


Switch (Two figures with two exchanging arrows)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 After Isaac and his friends join your party you have 8 characters at your 
disposal. In combat you can only use four at a time, so you are allowed to 
exchange 1 member from the back up party to the attacking party each turn. 
Using this you can interchange characters, if you really need to. Take note 
that all four members of the back up party automatically appear if the 
first party is completely downed.


Flee (Running figure)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 You can always try to run away in a regular battle and most of the time 
this will be successful. Sometimes however there will be no escape and you 
will have to endure the attacks of your enemies without having a chance to 
strike back. So I recommend not to overuse this option, and I think you 
won't need to if keep your party maintained you can take on most regular 
enemies without too much effort on reasonable levels.


Status (Three papers)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 Before you start combat you may wish to check your statistics and such. 
You can do this by selecting this option. I myself hardly ever use it, 
though.


Battle Methods
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Take note that you can always go back to the Battle Options by canceling 
(pressing 'B') in this menu. You can also use this to go back some steps if 
you reconsider the attack you had assigned to a character.

Attack (figure swinging with a sword)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 Use this option for a direct physical attack on 1 enemy with the weapon 
your character is currently holding. If the targeted enemy gets killed 
before he can land a blow the computer automatically executes the Defend 
command for that character.


Psynergy (figure with a whirl of energy)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 Use battle Psynergy on one or more targets. You will get an additional 
list of the possible Psynergies that character can use. After selecting the 
Psynergy you can (in most cases) choose the target on which the spell must 
be applied to. If this is also a multi target spell the Psynergy will have 
most effect on the center target; the enemy with the biggest Cursor arrow 
over its head.
 The power of the Psynergy is mainly determined by the amount of Elemental 
Power that you have for that element. You can see the elemental power of 
each character in the statistics screen; these powers can reach a value up 
to 200, which is the maximum limit. Also take note that the Psynergy will 
do less damage if the corresponding Elemental Resistance of the target is 
higher.


Unleash Djinn (Venus Djinni)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 Using this you can unleash the special ability of a Djinni in combat. Most 
of these attacks are quite strong and useful, do be careful that after you 
unleash a Djinni your characters power decreases a bit since the Djinn will 
go to Set mode. Finally the statistics may drop even more when your class 
degrades to a lower type, because the Djinni is no longer on Stand-by. On 
the other hand 'Setting' more Djinn allows you to use stronger Summon 
attacks at the start of the battle.


Summon (Tall black creature in a cube)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 The summon attacks are truly the most devastating attacks you party 
members can use. The Summon of a single Djinni on itself is not that 
strong, but you can use Summons of up to 13 Djinn (Iris) simultaneously. 
These Summons are the very strong and if unleashed by a character of the 
same element they are even powerful. For example: When a Venus Adept 
summons a Venus elemental Summon he/she can do more damage than the other 
three elemental type members could do.


Item (Opened Chest)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 You can use items like Herbs and Elixirs in battle to heal and cure your 
party members, but also you can use some of the weapons and armors. Since 
some of these have an ability so you can use them as an item, be warned 
that Weapons/Armors/Rings you use in battle may break if you use them too 
often (Sometimes they already break the first time I use them). If this 
happens the object will become useless and you will have to fix it at one 
of the Weapon / Armor Stores around the continents.


Defend (Shield)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 This option can be used if you don't want a specific character to attack. 
In Defend mode a character will raise its defense and thus will take less 
damage. Enemies sometimes do this too and oddly it seems that for your 
enemy the defend works the entire turn, meaning that they have high defense 
even before they actually get a chance to defend.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Environmental Elements
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Around the world you will come across various puzzles that need to be 
solved, these puzzles usually consist of making use of the objects that are 
nearby in your surroundings. Here is a small list of the some of these 
elements that you may encounter during the extensive travels.

Foliage
- - - -
 These little green bushes look lighter than the average normal looking 
ones that are in the background. If you use "Whirlwind" or "Gale" on them 
they may reveal hidden passages or objects.


Pillars / Columns
- - - - - - - - -
 There are several types of pillars in this game and all of them can be 
pushed around. Some however serve for other purposes too.

  -Tall & Thin pillars
    These are roughly twice the length of Felix and can be used for
    creating passages on the upper level of a map (climb a ladder first)
    and you can walk over the tops of these columns.
   
  -Small & Fat pillars
    Only a few of these pop up in your adventure. Usually you have to push
    these into the water so only the top will stick out creating a little
    bridge Felix can use to reach the other side of the water.

  -Fallen Pillars / Logs
    The kind pillars you'll find on the ground are the ones you can push
    around (if no objects are blocking them). Most of the time you have
    to push them in a certain order to create the desired path through a
    maze.


Sphere Boulder
- - - - - - - -
 This kind of obstruction appears very late in the game. The only way to 
get past them is by using "Lift" Psynergy which you can obtain after Isaac 
joins you.


Water Puddles / Ice Pillars
- - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 Water puddles can be frozen using "Frost" in order to create a tall ice 
pillar. These columns can then be melted into water puddles again by 
placing a heat source next to them like a torch.


Small Plants
- - - - - - -
 In some places you will come across little plants that are standing up 
against a wall similar to GS1. These plants can be transformed into long 
climbing vines if you apply "Growth" on them. Reminder again: in order to 
get "Growth" give Felix a Mars Djinn or Garet a Venus Djinn. Apart from 
that some new type of plant appears in Gaia Rock, if you use "Growth" on 
these they will become guidance arrows.


Soft Sand
- - - - -
 If you are on soft (desert) sand like in the Yampi Desert Felix can cast 
"Sand" in order to submerge underground. This way he can travel past rocks 
and other obstacles. Above all you won't encounter any enemies, while 
residing beneath the surface.
 Another thing is that Desert / Soft Sand is usually a good location to use 
"Scoop" on in order to find hidden items. In fact if you "Scoop" long 
enough you always find weak random items like: Smoke Bomb, Sleep Bomb, 
Elixir, 'random number below 10' Coins or a Game Ticket!


Suspicious Marks
- - - - - - - - -
 If you come across some stones that form a circle, a peculiar lone rock or 
other odd (out of place) looking configurations try to use the "Reveal" 
formula Ivan obtains just before traversing through the Lamakan Desert. 
Also "Reveal" can also be used to make hidden objects (in pots, crates) 
appear as twinkling little stars! This helps you searching every bit a lot 
faster. Sometimes marks on the group mean that you need to use "Scoop".



===========================================================================
Main Characters
===========================================================================

Felix - Venus Adept (18 years)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 We don't get to know too much about Felix other than that he was taken 
away by the river after the accident during the storm with the boulder that 
also took his parents leaving his sister Jenna behind as a lonely orphan. 
Saturos & Menardi however rescued him for some reason and he makes his 
reentrance in Vale again. He has different ideas about the issue of Alchemy 
than Isaac. Unlike him he wants to see the lighthouses lit again. Near the 
end of the game his motives become clear.
 Pros: Overall character; not particularly excelling or weak in any region 
 Cons: -

Initial Equipment
-----------------------
Weapon  Short Sword
Armor   Cotton Shirt
Shield  Padded Gloves
Helmet  -

Items   1. Mythril Bag - Holds Jupiter Star (Cannot be removed)
        2. Shaman's Rod
        3. Herb (2x)

Djinn   -
-----------------------


Jenna - Mars Adept (17 years)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 She lost her parents and her brother Felix after the accident that you saw 
in the Prologue of GS1. Jenna decided to come along with Isaac and Garet to 
Sol Sanctum, but after she does so she is captured by Saturos and Menardi. 
In GS:tLA the game starts with her as the leading character just before the 
Venus Lighthouse is lit. Traveling together with Kraden and Alex she have 
to travel back to Idejima to the boat which is docked over there.
 Pros: Powerful healing abilities combined with attack Psynergies
 Cons: As with the other girls she is a somewhat weaker than average,
       but better than Sheba or Mia.

Sheba - Jupiter Adept (14 years)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Even more mysterious than Felix is Sheba, this young girl appears near the 
end of the game. She is called "Child of the Gods" by the people of 
Lalivero, because according to them she fell from the sky as a gift from 
God. Lord Babi held her hostage for a long time so he could enforce the 
people of Lalivero to build him his own lighthouse for his own needs. 
Because didn't have any parents Faran from Lalivero raised her as his own 
child, therefore she sees him as a father figure.

not commit. Later on after you proved his innocence he leaves for Kibombo 
trying to find the Black Orb the Kibombo warriors stole from him. He needs 
the item to enter his ship and find a way back to his home town. After you 
help him getting his precious item back he joins your party and helps you

-----------------------


Isaac - Venus Adept (17 years)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Isaac is born and raised in Vale with his mother Dora and his father Kyle. 
The people of Vale have always been the protectors of the Elemental stars 
that are hidden deep within Sol Sanctum to the north of Vale. After the 
dreadful incident with the boulder on the rainy day Isaac lost his father 
just as Jenna lost her parents and brother. A few years later Isaac goes 
with Garet, Jenna and Kraden to Sol Sanctum to find out its secrets. Inside 
they meet the two people who are their enemies: Saturos & Menardi. They 
take Jenna and Kraden away, leaving him and Garet behind in the crumbling 
ruins. After this event they set foot outside of Vale on their quest to 
stop the two fiends. The young Venus Adept appears again in the Jupiter 
Lighthouse, and not long after that he will team up with you as the other 
three members of his party. 
 Pros: Overall character; not particularly excelling or weak in any region 
 Cons: -


Garet - Mars Adept (17 years)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Born in Vale as well is Isaac's childhood friend. Garet is the grandson of 
the mayor of Vale. He travels with Isaac right from the start of the game 
and he usually makes rather dumb comments during the conversations though, 
but is a good fighter although he is rather slow.
 Pros: Physically the strongest member of the team
 Cons: He the slowest party member


Ivan - Jupiter Adept (15 years)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This young boy was an orphan found by Master Hammet the merchant of Kalay. 
Ivan's most useful ability is to read other peoples' minds, which can be 
handy during some parts of the game. Master Hammet gave the mystical 
Shaman's Rod (also called the Rod of Hesperia) to Ivan and he seems to have 
lost it somewhere in Vault a village to the south of Vale. At the end of 
GS1 Felix claims the rod from him. That's why Felix has the Shaman's Rod in 
his inventory at the beginning of the game.
 Pros: Very fast chap
 Cons: His physical attacks are weak


Mia - Mercury Adept (17 years)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The fourth adept of Isaac's team is Miss Mia from icy village called Imil 
to the far north. She is protector of the Mercury Lighthouse just like Alex 
who happens to be a Mercury Adept as well. Mia's greatest asset is her 
healing abilities. She is capable of healing the entire party with her Wish 
Psynergy. Other than that her attack is not that bad, although her Mercury 
classes lack some strong attack Psynergies like "Prism".
 Pros: Great Healing abilities
 Cons: She is somewhat slow (but not as much as Garet)



===========================================================================
Other important people
===========================================================================

Alex
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This guy appears in the beginning of the game where he wards of some 
Laliverian guards so Jenna and Kraden can escape. Later on he turns up in 
several towns. In Champa you find out that he is together with a new duo 
from the Mars clan: Agatio & Karst. He is not an ally to anybody, and just 
wants all the lighthouses to be lit for his own reasons. Alex is like Mia 
from the Mercury Clan and has an oath to protect the Mercury Lighthouse, 
but he broke that oath for his own good.


Babi - (Near 150 years - deceased recently)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The ancient mayor of Tolbi has strange vitality for someone of his 
unnatural old age. In turned out that he used a drought from Lemuria to 
keep him going around, however over time this drought is nearly completely 
depleted leaving him old and frail again. In Golden Sun 1 he sent out 
Isaac, Garet, Ivan and Mia to search for Lemuria using his ship.


Karst & Agatio
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Karst is a young woman from the same clan as Saturos and Menardi and she 
is a relative of Menardi. Isaac killed Menardi in GS1 on top of the Venus 
Lighthouse, and because of that Karst out on the loose searching for 
vengeance.
 Agatio is her companion and they travel together in order to find Felix, 
because they know that he has the Jupiter Star; an item that is required 
to ignite the Jupiter Lighthouse.


King Hydros - Ruler of Lemuria
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 After reaching Lemuria you get to go on audience with the king. This (what 
seems to be) a middle aged man has much knowledge. King Hydros will tell 
you about his finding of Weyard decreasing in size as the world withers and 
this is all because alchemy isn't released on the world to nourish it. 
After hearing this Felix & companions are even more determined to light the 
remaining two lighthouses. After this you will get the Grind Stone from his 
possession. 


Kraden - (Too old)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The old man is a scholar who lives on the far west side of Vale. He has 
studied alchemy for quite some time and has vast knowledge about it, 
although the long conversations with him seem to be annoying sometimes. 
Kraden helps Felix and the others with silly comments. I usually don't pay 
too much attention to him.


Saturos & Menardi
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 They are two adepts from the Mars clan who live in the far northern 
reaches of Weyard in a town named Prox. They were killed in Golden Sun by 
Isaac's group. Now that they are gone Karst and Agatio have appeared on the 
scene to avenge their death.



===========================================================================
Story            (Taken from the Instruction Booklet)
===========================================================================


Alchemy - The power to manipulate the building blocks of reality - has been 
sealed away for generations. This ancient science has been hidden deep 
within Sol Sanctum and protected by the small village of Vale, which lies 
at the foot of Mount Aleph, home to Sol Sanctum. Now, however, that seal 
has been broken, and the Elemental Stars, the jewels that channel the power 
of alchemy, have been stolen.
Stories tell that the master of alchemy knows no limits to his power and 
can attain everything his heart desires. Using the four jewels, someone is 
trying to light the elemental lighthouses and release of the power of 
alchemy upon the world of Weyard. The lighthouses of earth and water have 
already been lit. Now, a great adventure across the open seas in search of 
the remaining two lighthouses begins!

Walkthrough
===========================================================================


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Beforehand
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Registry--
 At the registry it is possible to give all main characters from the game a 
new name. Normally you can only rename Felix and also for Isaac, but if you 
like you can change the other names by pressing the following button 
combination as given below. I will keep to the default names myself to make 
the walkthrough clear and easier to read.


Rename - Jenna, Sheba and Piers
-------------------------------
 When you get to rename Felix at the beginning of a New Game press 'Select' 
3 times. You will hear a chime. Complete his name and you get to rename the 
other three members.


Rename - Isaac, Garet, Ivan and Mia
-----------------------------------
When you are renaming the characters from GS:tLA press the following button 
combination:
               Up,   Down,  Up,   Down,
               Left, Right, Left, Right,
               Up,   Right, Down, Left,  Up

Now press 'Select' and there will be chime as well. Take note that this 
only works, when you are playing a non-linked game.


Import Golden Sun 1 Data
------------------------
 After renaming everybody of tLA's party to your heart's content you get 
the chance of uploading the information of the Clear Data file in GS. After 
you finish Golden Sun you can transport the data of Isaac and companions 
over to this game. Check out Appendix E for more information about this 
topic. If you don't import Gold or Silver data you get to rename Isaac as 
well. After this moment you also get a peek at what the GS1 party 
characters have in their inventory after you insert the password. This is 
done so you can verify whether everything is still in its place.


Choose your difficulty setting
------------------------------
If you have a completed game in the shape of a "Clear Data" file on the 
cartridge you can get the option of choosing a difficulty setting. There 
are three difficulties you may choose from:

  Easy:   You get the levels you had in the previous game, making the
          battles even easier to complete in this game! No items are
          transferred; this is not Chrono Trigger sorry...

  Normal: Same as a normal game (nothing special happens).

  Hard:   Start a normal game, but the enemies have increased statistics:
          150% Max HP, 125% ATK & 125% DEF.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prologue: The Venus lighthouse from a different point of view
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Venus Lighthouse--
Chests: 1 (total hidden items / chests: 1)
 Herb
Monsters:
 Ruffian

 We start at the Venus Lighthouse; this was the second and last lighthouse 
that was to be lit in the original Golden Sun. This game however starts 
just before it was lit. The difference now is that we start with a party of 
Felix, Jenna and Kraden. The last one is a Non Playable Character (NPC). As 
Felix departs from the group the other two go down and meet up with Alex; a 
mysterious adept from the Mercury clan. After doing some chitchat (get used 
to it, because we have to do this many times) it is decided that the three 
of them should leave the lighthouse and wait for Felix at Idejima. You gain 
control over Jenna from this moment on. Most curiously Jenna starts at 
level 5 by default instead of level 1 and she has a default set of 
equipment (so Jenna's information is not transferred in a linked game).

 There are no random battles around here leaving you free to roam anywhere 
you like without having to deal with pesky cretins all the time. From the 
start go left, down, and then take the upper right passage and Jenna will 
find herself in a stepping stone puzzle. People who have played GS can 
easily get to the exit here, but for the others it is important to remember 
that you can only jump over 1-tile gaps, so take the left route and you'll 
find a chest in the room after this. This was the chest containing the 
"Carry Stone" and it was already opened by Isaac's team, but for some 
reason it has an additional Herb is inside if you check it out. Strange... 
It wasn't there in Golden Sun.

 Retrace your steps to the big room and this time take the south exit. Once 
you get outside you will be hindered by some soldiers. Alex pops up again 
and wipes them out with a single blow. After this the road is cleared to 
the Suhalla Gate and Alex leaves the scene so he can make sure no other 
soldiers will meddle with Jenna and Kraden. Head west for our very first 
fight, it is an easy one though. With only two strikes (about 30 damage) 
or one "Fume" psynergy the Ruffian goes down (of course if you are 
replaying this game in Hard mode it will be a bit more difficult).


--Suhalla Gate--
Monsters:
 Ruffian

 Continue on and you'll have to fight another Ruffian, which is identical 
to the last one. Go left, climb down the two vines and try to enter the 
crevice. Three Ruffians appear this time round. So we better start using 
some Psynergy to take them out quickly. You should still be able to win 
without having to heal, if not use an Herb to heal about 50 HP.


--Gateway Cave--
Monsters:
 Punch Ant

 There is only one direction here so stick to it. After some walking you 
will come across a purple jewel. This is a Psynergy stone that can heal all 
you Psynergy Points, but before you can collect it a Punch Ant appears. BTW 
for those of you new to Golden Sun, you can recover your Psynergy slowly by 
walking around in the field. After some crappy comments of Kraden, Jenna 
can reach the peninsula without any difficulty.


--Idejima--
 Alex reappears and the Venus Lighthouse beacon is lit (once again), 
resulting in a mighty tremble. This causes Idejima to tear apart from the 
continent of Gondowan. After this we get to see the same dialogue as in the 
epilogue of the last game (although the island looks different somehow), 
Felix and Sheba join the others and the five of them crash into the 
continent of Indra near the village of Daila riding along the tidal wave 
and land-wrecking into the continent of Indra.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The Trial Temple
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Idejima--
As you regain consciousness you get control over Felix the main character 
of this game. You can check for injuries if you like to see some silly 
animations. Check for the others (yes, you have to take even Kraden with 
you) and oddly enough Alex disappeared somehow. Walk around on the world 
map and Felix will find a small town to the south of where we started. Take 
note that you can equip the "Shaman's Rod" in your inventory to one of the 
girls, its ATK (attack power) is better than the wooden stick.


--Daila--
Inn:
 6 Coins
Hidden Items: 7 (8)
 Smoke Bomb      - Inside lower left barrel outside inn 
 Sleep Bomb      - Inside barrel near entrance inside the inn
 3 Coins         - Inside jar within the house on the right in Daila
 12 Coins        - Inside jar left side of Mayor's home (elevated building)
 Herb            - Inside jar behind Mayor's home
 Psy Crystal~    - Use "Scoop" on NE tile of the rightmost water puddle
 Sea God's Tear* - Use "Frost" on the pillars in the Sanctuary

                   * = Reachable after chapter 6
                   ~ = Reachable after chapter 4A

 This small village is still recovering from the big splash, which is why 
there are salty puddles all over the place. I bought a new sword for Felix 
here and also some better armor for all three characters, since you should 
have some money by now. Talk with the villagers if you like. If you do so 
some of the residents give you information about the Kandorean Temple of 
Master Poi. Note that behind the guy in the sanctuary there is a blue drop 
shaped rock. We cannot yet reach it, but we will get back here some point 
later on. Leave town via the southern exit and go to the temple that all 
those people mention.


--Daila (South) - World Map-- 
Djinn:
 Venus - Echo

 Felix will encounter the first Djinn in this game right around here. He 
will join you no matter what you say, refuse him a few times for some nice 
comments. ;) You can choose for a brief introduction (which is very similar 
to the one in GS). From here you can go into two directions: east to the 
Tower of the Sea God, or southwest to the Kandorean Temple. Heading east 
only gives you a small cut scene and nothing more, since Felix doesn't have 
the right Psynergy to continue on around there. 


--Kandorean Temple--
Hidden Items: 1 (9)
 Lash Pebble
Chests: 1 (10)
 Mysterious Card
Djinn: 
 Mercury - Fog
Monsters:
 Mimic, Amaze, Angler Worm, Giant Bat, Punch Ant, Wild Wolf
Boss: 
 Chestbeater (3x)

 The entrance of the temple is locked tightly, because of the meditation 
session that started just ago. Felix must find another path into the 
temple. Go to the upper left corner and use "Whirlwind" Psynergy on the 
bush to enter the cave. Walk around the shallow water and climb the rope on 
the far right. The central door in the courtyard is your entrance to the 
temple itself.

 Inside Master Poi is putting three of his students to the test. Only the 
third one's ability to levitate is good enough to undergo the final test. 
We might as well follow this guy as there is not much else to do. Go up in 
the cavern to find the very first Mimic chest of this game. The critter has 
quite some HP so don't hesitate in using strong Psynergies like Jenna's 
"Fume", beating it earns you a Game Ticket.
-------
Mimic 1
-------
 HP:  207    ATK:  47    AGL:   23    Weak:    Fire
 PP:   12    DEF:  12    LCK:   15    Strong:  Water
 Special: Debilitate, Psy Drain, Sleep, Slash
 Exp:     64
 Coins:   46
 Item: Game ticket

 Navigate through the tight corridor on the left towards the next room. 
Walk to the lower left corner here to find the bloke who does not seem to 
be strong enough to undergo the test after all, I pity the fool. Head up 
from here walking between the long pillars, because there is a passage 
although it is partially hidden behind the pillars. Climb the ladder and 
jump over the gaps using the tops of the columns to reach the passageway. 
Go left here and you'll reach a treacherous current. Use the 'B' Button to 
run diagonally up to the right (this way you will reach the other side 
without sliding down). Keep on going up through the maze of rocks and you 
will reach a room with a moveable pillar and two air vents.

 If you want the Mysterious Card then push the pillar on the left platform. 
The weight of the pillar will keep the other platform in its position 
allowing you to reach a higher level. Stand on the right platform to ascend 
and reach out for the chest with that item. You can equip this item to any 
character and it will turn him/her into the Pierrot Class. Stand on the 
platform again, when it reappears to go down one level again. Push the 
pillar on the lower platform and walk on the left one. Go over the 
tightrope and walk behind the pole so you will reach a moveable pillar. 
Push it to the right using the "Move" Psynergy, jump over the gap and keep 
on pushing it further until it blocks the shaft.

 You can safely go over the second rope. DON'T go down the ladder, but 
instead follow the path on the right side, jump over some gaps and enter 
the next area. There is a Mercury Djinni here, but we can't reach it just 
yet. Go up the stairs twice and use "Move" on the pot with boiling water in 
order to chuck it aside. Walk up to find the last challenge meant for Poi's 
Student.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Chestbeater (3x)
----------------------
 HP: 155    ATK: 44     AGL: 20     Weak:    Fire
 PP:   0    DEF: 11     LCK: 24     Strong:  Wind
 Special: Beat Dance, use 'Herb', Claw Attack
 Exp.:   40 each
 Coins:  28 each
 Item:   Nut

 These three monkeys are not that hard to beat, just concentrate your 
attacks on one of them (and use your strongest Psynergies) to take them out 
one by one. The Claw attack may cause some damage, but other than that 
there doesn't seem to be any trouble at all.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 A ladder will appear leading you towards the exit. Poi will think that his 
student completed the test, but is amazed to see that an outsider managed 
to do it without any training. You will receive the Psynergy "Lash" from 
the 'spring chicken' for your troubles in the shape of the Lash Pebble. 
Equip this rock on one of your characters in order to use the Psynergy. My 
suggestion would be Sheba, since she has the most Psynergy Points at her 
disposal.

 Since we can get the Mercury Djinni with this Psynergy go back where we 
came from. Stand next to the pole with rope tied to it and use "Lash" to 
tie the end to the other pole automatically. Climb the rope and get ready 
for a battle (not all Djinn can be collected without a fight).
--------------
Mercury Djinni
--------------
 HP: 165    ATK: 32    AGL: 22      Weak:    Fire
 PP:  14    DEF:  6    LCK:  6      Strong:  Water
 Special: Douse, Frost, Escape
 Exp:     28
 Coins:   85
 Item: -

 The special attacks of this Djinni are pretty strong compared to the level 
your characters are on right now, so heal Sheba if her HP bar drops is less 
than a half (she has weak defense). After beating it Fog will join you. 
Because we don't have a Mercury Adept yet, think carefully to whom you are 
going to set it (if you set it at all). My pick would be Sheba so she gains 
some additional HP, also using the Mysterious Card she turns into a 
Pierrot, giving her extra power and two attack Psynergies. For now this is 
the best we can do for her. Use "Retreat" for a quick exit away from the 
dungeon. The meditation session has ended and thus you can leave through 
the front door.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Team rascal: Riki & Tavi  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Shrine of the Sea God (first visit)--
Hidden Items: 1 (11)
 Right Prong* - See Chapter 8A.
Chests: 1 (12)
 Rusty Staff* (forges into Glower Staff)
Djinn:
 Jupiter - Breath
Monsters:
 Angle Worm, Ghost, Punch Ant, Wild Wolf

 * = reachable after Piers joins you

 Next stop is the Shrine of the Sea God located to the east of Daila. We 
can only get a Jupiter Djinni there for the time being. However we do need 
to save the two boys here, or else we can't move on to enable some upcoming 
events.

 If have already been here before you know that there is a place where we 
can use our newly acquired "Lash" Psynergy. In case you haven't been here 
yet, just watch the small cut scene featuring two rascal boys. After 
securing the rope Tavi thinks Riki threw the rope and he climbs down. Then 
both of them meet with your group and talk about catching a small flying 
critter, but because they are hungry they leave. Go through the left 
passageway and walk around until you find that flying beast; yep, a Jupiter 
Djinni. After you fall down the Djinni flies off, go after it right away!

 You can follow the footsteps in the next room, or just go to the south 
right away. There are three passageways around here. Take the most southern 
one and the Djinni will appear again. Go back up again and go through 
either one of the other two stairways, the Jupiter Djinni will appear again 
and move upwards. Follow it again and the Djinn will move to an elevated 
section. Place the torch against the northern wall so the Djinni will get 
trapped if it tries to flee again. Attack it and you'll have to fight it.
--------------
Jupiter Djinni
--------------
 HP:  184    ATK: 37    AGL: 27     Weak:    Earth
 PP:   16    DEF:  8    LCK:  6     Strong:  Wind
 Special:  Bolt, Ray, Slash, Whirlwind, Escape
 Exp:     43
 Coins:   89
 Item: -

 Not much special to note about this Djinni, he seems to be easier to beat 
than that Mercury Djinni. After a short battle Breath joins you group, 
giving a total of 3 Djinn. We can't do anything with those water puddles, 
hence we have to leave this place and come back sometime later.


--Daila--
 After freeing Tavi most of the salty water has dried up, leaving only some 
small water puddles around the scene. Try to enter the mayor's home and 
Alex will show up again. He speaks about buying a boat in the city of Madra 
to the south. Just after that he leaves you again. In order to get to Madra 
we have to go through the Dehkan Plateaus, this location can be found by 
going southeast from Daila, then go over the small bridge and head to the 
left.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Falling through the Plateaus
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Dehkan Plateau--
Hidden Items: 1 (13)
 Pound Cube - Mars Djinni Cannon has it
Chests: 5 (18)
 Full Metal Vest, Elixir, Mint, Themis Axe, Nut
Djinn:
 Mars - Cannon
Monsters:
 Angle Worm, Ghost, Mini-Goblin, Rat Soldier, Skeleton

 You don't have much choice in the beginning, so walk around until you fall 
down one of those cracked gaps. You can see by the darker tone of the crack 
whether you can walk over it (once) or not. Anyway, after falling down take 
the lower passage and collect the Full Metal Vest from the chest, the very 
first new armor (i.e. not available in GS). Go back again and once you're 
inside the cave take the other exit on the right side.

 Further on you will see three grey pillars here, be careful because Felix 
can only stand on them once just as with the cracked floor tiles. First 
take the upper path in order to collect an Elixir. Climb back up, take the 
lower path and go south for the northern path is block by a cone shaped 
structure. Carefully walk over the little cracks avoiding the bigger cracks 
(BTW. you can't fall down a gap, but you can jump over it). Fall down the 
most northern dark crack to access a chest containing Mint.

 Once you are back outside again move the pillar in its place and jump over 
the gap. Walk over the lower left crack so you can reach the center again, 
instead of falling down jump over the gap (not crack) so you reach the 
right. Keep on going up to find another area filled with columns. Hop over 
to the first 'island', take the upper left pillar, jump over another island 
and jump twice on the lone pillar to the right. Here is a path to another 
chest with the Themis Axe inside. This is quite a good weapon for Felix and 
it has 'Stone Justice' as an Unleash. Since the first pillar crumbled we 
have to go back one screen and return to reset the field and make the 
pillars appear instantly complete again.

 This second time round just jump over to the left side, from there on the 
path to the next screen is easily found. Again we have to fall down one of 
the gaps around here; it doesn't matter which one. After getting back 
outside you'll see a Mars Djinni who tries to flee away from you, fall down 
the first gap(you don't have any choice), go outside, climb the vine and 
meet up with our Mars Djinni who leaves again. Before venturing on, put the 
pillar in between the gap for this will be handy later on.

 On the next screen the Djinni runs away over the bridge again, before 
going after him climb down the vine below, go over the tight ropes and move 
the lower pillar as far as possible to the right. Climb it using the 
overgrowth and use "Lash" to get a Nut. Let the upper pillar fall down, 
follow the path, climb the vines on the far right and watch how the Djinni 
uses "Pound" in order to escape from you. Follow him to the next screen 
where he crumbles 2 pillars in order to get away from you once more. Climb 
down the vine and move the pillar to the right, climb it, go to the other 
two grey pillars and step on the rightmost one. When you walk back you fall 
down. Walk around to the rightmost pillar and use "Move" to get it to the 
left. Climb on it as well and make the other grey pillar fall apart.

 Head north into the cavern, walk over the upper left crack (the small 
one), walk on the crack to the Djinni's right (not the one in front of 
him), then go down and right so you can reach the passage to the next room. 
Follow the path and head outside fall down the RIGHT darkened crack and you 
bump into the Djinni who loses its precious cube shaped artifact. Step over 
to the Pound Cube and equip it (don't go strait up, or else you fall 
down!). Take the passage on the right and you'll encounter the little 
cretin for the final showdown.

 It is time to stop his evil escapades, but before going near him climb 
down the vine and use "Pound" to smash the cone into the ground. Finally 
the Mars Djinni is stuck, however it doesn't seem to be that afraid since 
he starts a battle against you!

 HP: 203      ATK:  43    AGL: 32       Weak:    Water

 Special: Blast, Flare, Escape
 Exp:     58
 Coins:   93
 Item: -

 This Djinni tends to run away very often so if possible try to stun him or 
put him asleep. Other than that it should be relatively easy especially 
with the Mercury Djinni's Unleash. After the battle Cannon finally joins 
your team. Continue on and ascend several levels until you reach the exit 
of the Dehkan Plateau. 


--East Indra Shore--
Hidden Items: 1 (19)
 Cookie* - Use "Frost" on the water puddle to reach the wooden box
           * = reachable after Piers joins you

 There is a ship very close by the exit of the Dehkan plateau on the world 
map. If you enter this area all party members show up and Kraden thinks it 
is Menardi's ship, but they don't have the orb to control the ship rendering 
it is useless to them. There is a peculiar barrel on a ledge here, but we 
need "Frost" to get it, so we'll have to come back later as well.


--Indra Cavern--
Stone Tablet:
 Zagan

 To the west of the ship the is a small cavern, use "Move" and "Lash" to 
get the stone tablet lying out in the open. This will give you a new 
summon: Zagan by putting both one Venus & one Mars Djinn on standby! Zagan 
appears to be aligned with the Mars elemental and can lower enemies' DEF as 
well.


--Madra East - World Map--
Djinn: 
 Venus - Iron

 To the east of Madra you can go over a small bridge and you will come 
across a Venus Djinni at the bottom part near the water. Defeat it to make 
Iron join you, if the Djinni escapes just walk around and it will appear 
again.

4. The Mysterious Prisoner Adept
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Madra--
Inn:
 12 Coins
Hidden Items: 6 (25)
 Antidote     - Wooden box outside the home to the left of town's entrance
 Smoke Bomb   - barrel in the house to the left of town's entrance
 Sleep Bomb   - left jar upstairs in the inn
 Elixir       - jar in left cavern home
 15 coins     - wooden box in the town elder's home
 Cyclone Chip - Get it from the young Mayor want-to-be (after Chapter 6)
Chests: 1 (26)
 Nurse's Cap
Djinn:
 Mars - Char

 The upper right corner has a ladder leading into the ground, if you try to 
go down a man pops up telling you that you have to come back later if you 
wish to enter. Upon entering town via the main gate two people inspect you 
in order to make sure that you are not one of Champa's men. Some pirates 
raided Madra and came for a guy named Briggs, that's why the security in 
this region is raised. After participating in this event you can climb down 
that ladder into the catacombs of Madra to collect the Tremor Bit. There is 
more than one entrance to the catacombs, but you can only reach the Bit by 
going down the rightmost one behind the graveyard to the east (see below).

 You can walk around various places around here. First of all go to the 
balcony of the inn and walk over the roofs of the market tents to the left, 
jump over and collect the Nurse Cap. Also note the old man inside the 
biggest home on the left. He is interested in mushrooms from the Gondowan 
Cliffs. Later on when you pass by there you can collect the Laughing and 
Healing Fungus. The Laughing Fungus is useless, but if you give him the 
Healing Fungus he will trade it for Char the Mars Djinn.


--Madra Catacombs--
Chests: 5 (31)
 Tremor Bit, Lucky Medal*, Apple~, Mist Potion~, Ruin Key~
Stone Tablet:
 Moloch~
Monsters:
  Drone Bee, Mini-Goblin, Rat, Rat Soldier, Troll

  * = reachable after learning "Reveal" 
  ~ = reachable after learning "Reveal" & "Frost"

Entry from the graveyard (only accessible first time round):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Go through two screens following the upper path, down the ladder and take 
the up-left passageway to reach a deserted subterranean village. Use "Move" 
on the pillar on the elevated section on the northern part, continue on to 
the left and enter the entrance in the wall. Inside descend to the bottom 
floor and head up one room to find a chest with the Tremor Bit. That's all 
we can do around here.

However, if you do this after passing by the initial trip to Madra the
cave entrance will be blocked off. You'll need "Reveal" psynergy first
to get through the catacombs via the other entrance!

Entry from the main ladder:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
After obtaining "Frost" and "Reveal" Psynergies go down the entrance 
inside the town walls of Madra. Back in the Catacombs, go down and left 
into the big room again. Use "Reveal" on the closed doorway to display a 
push button. Press it to open the door to the deserted town. 

 Walk around town, use "Frost" on the water puddle on your way and you'll 
reach a chest with an Apple. From here "Move" the 2 pillars to the east and 
north. Climb the northern pillar and run around the upper level to reach 
the eastern pillar. Jump over to the west, use "Lash" on the rope and enter 
the first floor of the broken building. Inside cast "Tremor" on the 
bookshelf to make a chest drop down. If you go inside the left entrance in 
the back of the main room, then walk around the main level counter 
clockwise to reach red chest with a Lucky Medal inside.

 Head outside again, follow the path and climb down to get a Mist Potion, 
then slide down the lower level of the town catacombs. Enter the building 
via the main entrance, go up one room and collect the Ruin Key from the 
chest that fell down. Go down the stair in the right room and use the key 
to open up the big, locked & red door. The flames will ignite and the 
tablet on display is now yours. After examining it Felix can summon Moloch 
for the price of 2 Mercury & 1 Jupiter Djinn.


--Madra--
 Felix is back at the entrance of town, so if you didn't go down (which you 
should do anyway) you can continue on reading here. Talking to the people 
around here tells you that they think the boat docked at the shore is a 
boat from Champa. Mind reading the ill person in the left cavern home gives 
you a vague hint of what is coming next. Inside the town elder's home you 
can see a very interesting gem on the mantel, unfortunately we can't get 
it.

 Outside again to the left is the town's jail. The people around here speak 
of the imprisoned guy who came ashore with his ship. They claim he's from 
Champa's camp, but you can never be certain without verifying this. So 
Felix goes to meet the man in question.

 Inside some people are interrogating the prisoner who is called Piers. 
Piers claims that he is innocent and even uses Psynergy to ward of one of 
the interrogators. "Mind read" him tells you that he seems to be able to 
sense you Psynergy as well. Exiting the prison at this point starts a small 
conversation and the woman grants you permission to travel to Osenia to the 
east.


--Osenia Cliffs--
 Chests: 1 (32)
  Pirate's Sword

 After obtaining permission from 'milady' cross over the Madra Drawbridge 
and you'll reach some cliffs around here, talk to the people for some 
information (this is not mandatory). One of the guys reasons that Piers is 
not a Champa and therefore should be released. Jump over the garbage that 
is left after the Champa Ship broke apart, use "Lash" to reach the Pirate's 
Sword inside a lone chest. Head over to the exit on the right side.

 We can do two independent quests at this moment, but we do have to 
complete both of them. One quest is to prove Piers' innocence and another 
has to be completed so Sheba will learn "Reveal" Psynergy. The first quest 
(starting at 4A) has somewhat easier enemies than the second (chapter 5) so 
I'll put that one up first. You can go either way, so make the choice for 
your own.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
4A. Trapping a scorpion in the desert
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Yampi Desert (Exterior)--
Hidden Items: 2 (34)
  Scoop Gem, 315 Coins
Chests: 4 (38)
  Guardian Ring, Antidote, Lucky Medal*, Trainer's Whip
Djinn:
 Jupiter - Blitz
Monsters:
 Dino, Emu, Kobold, Momongo, Spider
Boss:
 King Scorpion

  * = reachable after learning "Reveal" 

 On the first screen you can find a chest in the right bottom corner, just 
smash the wooden pole to get the Guardian ring. On the next screen there 
are a bunch of people trying to find their way through the desert, talk
to them for some information. At the bottom of this field there is a 
peculiar shaped sand puddle. There is nothing we can do with it right now, 
but later on we will be able to use some Psynergy on it.

 In the next area stomp the pillar blocking your path to the north and do 
NOT "Pound" the one straight beneath the chest, as we require the path over 
the top. Instead, go around and use the Psynergy on the other pillar. Then 
walk over to collect an Antidote here. "Pound" the pillar hiding a 
climbable wall section and go up, walk and jump around, until you reach the 
Jupiter Djinni: Blitz. This Djinni also fights you before joining in. Just 
Unleash Echo and the rest should be easy as pie.
--------------
Jupiter Djinni

 HP: 267      ATK: 65      AGL:  50      Weak:    Earth
 PP:  24      DEF: 17      LCK:   8      Strong:  Wind
 Special: Bolt, Ray, Slash, Whirlwind, Escape
 Exp:     109
 Coins:   126
 Item: -

 Exit the screen on the right side and collect the Psynergy Stone if you 
wish to restore any PP (There is a boss battle coming up next). Go up one 
screen and you see that something is moving beneath the surface. Use 
"Pound" on the wooden column to make a scorpion appear and leave for the 
next screen. Repeat the process and you'll reach a third screen.

 The final sequence requires some planning in order to trap the scorpion. 
The easiest way to get it right is to use "Pound" on the right pillar just 
after he passes it while he's moving horizontally. Immediately use "Pound" 
and the creature is trapped. Prepare yourself for this battle, because it 
is not that easy if you haven't been to Air's Rock yet. If you get close 
it, he will use "Scoop" on you. The both of you fall down and the battle 
against the King Scorpion begins.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: King Scorpion
-------------------
 HP: 1064   ATK: 101   AGL: 39     Weak:    Fire
 PP:    0   DEF:  32   LCK: 40     Strong:  Wind
 Special: Defends, Desert Gasp, Paralytail, Poison Tail, Sand Breath,
          Twin Shear
 Exp.:   440
 Coins:  228
 Item:   Vial

 Immediately unleash Blitz, for this Djinni may stun your opponent. My 
strategy would be unleashing Djinn and using the Summon: Ramses or Zagan to 
hit the king hard. This boss tends to defend a lot, so it may be hard to 
get a good hit on him. Then again, if he defends he cannot hurt you either.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 After taking him down you receive the Scoop Gem, equip it to someone and 
use "Scoop" on the sand puddle in the middle of the screen between the four 
rocks to get a trip to the World Map again. Backtrack to the sand puddle 
that I mentioned earlier and use "Scoop" on it. Use the newly revealed 
ladder and follow the path, until you reach the group of people from the 
other side. A small conversation takes place and you can now exit via the 
northern passage. Only the sand puddle on the right holds treasure; 315 
Coins to be exact, after getting it continue on inside the northern cave. 
BTW: Using the Scoop Gem in various places might give you some random weak 
items, but sometimes a Game Ticket may appear!


--Yampi Desert (Interior)--
Chests: 2 (40)
  Blow Mace, Hard Nut
Monsters:
 Dino, Emu, Gnome, Kobold, Momongo, Spider

 Walk around the sand slides (use 'B' for easier navigation by running). 
The chest in the middle has a Hard Nut as a prize. Go with the flow and try 
to get on the main land near the middle, run up against the wall here and 
you'll make it across the sand slide. Continue upwards by running 
diagonally from side to side against the current. Stand on the ledge to the 
left of the chest then use "Pound" on the pillar blocking the road towards 
it, after doing so you can collect & equip the Blow Mace. Follow the slide, 
run to the right edge to exit the cave again.


--Yampi Desert (Exterior)--
 Outside again leave for the next field to the right. After this you'll 
come across a slide that is 3 squares wide. You might as well climb down 
here, for the upper section is a dead end (at least for a very long while). 
If you have "Reveal" from Air's Rock you can get a hint from the 9 rocks, 
but it won't do you any good at this moment. Further on the next set of 9 
rocks has a Lucky Medal if you cast "Reveal" on it. Don't worry if you 
don't have that Psynergy, yet. We'll go back here on a later occasion.

 Climb the wall here and run diagonally over the sand slides. On the left 
side of the screen use "Lash" to get the Trainer's Whip from the chest. Go 
back and climb the second wall in order to get to the top, then go to the 
right and fall down on the most right square of the right slide. This way 
you will make it to the exit.

 You can go either to the north (Alhafra) or the south (Air's Rock and 
Garoh) around here, but the southern exit is 1-way only. You will have to 
walk back all the way around if you wish to go to Alhafra (see 4B), so I 
_strongly_ suggest you go to the north first, then afterwards fall down 
here to complete the other events (see 5).



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
4B. The pirates' hideout in Alhafra
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Alhafra--
Inn:
 21 Coins
Hidden Items: 8 (48)
 Sleep Bomb  - Jar next to entrance Alhafran Cave
 Elixir      - Barrel in the upper half of the double house
 32 Coins    - Upper crate to the east of the Mayor's mansion
 7 Coins     - Barrel inside lower right room of the Mayor's mansion
 Smoke Bomb  - Upper left jar up the pier in Eastern Alhafra
 Large Bread - Use "Tremor" on the box in the backroom of the boat
 Apple       - Jar upper level of the inn
 Lucky Medal - Jar between two broken houses on the right
Chests: 1 (49)
 Psy Crystal - Use "Reveal" on the six gravestones
Boss:
 Briggs & Sea Fighters

 You can only get here if you went north after doing 4A, so go through the 
Yampi Desert first. If you walk around a bit here, the people you met in 
desert made it as well. Also this village was hit by the Tidal wave as 
well, meaning that there are no usable boats around here. Although there 
does appear to be a wrecked boat around (you can see in on the world map). 
Mind reading the man on the far left tells you something is going on around 
here. Unfortunately we cannot yet enter the Mayor's mansion, so investigate 
the other parts of Alhafra.

 If you go upstairs in the inn you'll meet Alex again. He has nothing 
special to say however. After he leaves (when you enter Champa) you can 
meet two sailors here, if you are playing a Linked Game. They speak about 
Crossbone Isle being swept clear by Isaac and his companions. One of the 
sailors also tells that Isaac even bested the 'dreaded' undead pirate 
Deadbeard. And because of this Isaac is bound to be the leader of all 
pirates, at least according to them. After the conversation they leave 
walking past Felix without even noticing him (whether Isaac is in the party 
or not doesn't matter).


--Eastern Alhafra--
 The boat's mast lying around here is badly damaged, after overhearing the 
conversation between the workers here you are free to walk around. Go 
inside the cabin and Felix will also overhear a conversation between Briggs 
and one of his mates. Then suddenly Jenna starts talking out loud, thus 
blowing their cover. Kraden wants Briggs to attest that Piers is innocent, 
but he doesn't want to so they start a fight.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Briggs & Sea Fighter
--------------------------
Briggs
 HP: 984     ATK: 129     AGL: 76      Weak:    All
 PP:   0     DEF:  29     LCK: 42      Strong:  -

 PP:    0    DEF:  28     LCK: 26      Strong:  -
 Special: Echo Cut, uses 'Smoke Bomb' / 'Herb' / 'Oil Drop'
 Exp.:    89
 Coins:  130
 Item:     -

As always when fighting humans, they are weak to all elements so the 
elemental type doesn't matter at all. Take note that Briggs can call for 
allies with Signal Whistle. Both enemies tend to use a lot of items like 
herbs and Briggs also has a nut healing him for about 200 points, so it may 
take some time to finish this battle. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
After the battle Briggs says he will cooperate with your terms and thus 
freeing Piers, then his wife named Chaucha appears and some more people as 
well. After a very long conversation it is decided that Briggs and his 
mates go to prison, but Chaucha and her child Eoleo may stay on the ship. 

You can try to clear the debris on the ship's mast, but you cannot yet 
remove the big rock that blocks the main mast. You'll need something more 
explosive here (See Chapter 7D for more information about this side quest). 
After doing all the things we can possible do leave the ship. We'll have to 
come back later. Talking to the mayor give you the opportunity to 
participate in another event, but for as long as the boat is stuck it won't 
start. BTW: You can give the Large Bread found on the ship to the crying 
little boy on the lower east side of Alhafra, in return his father will let 
you pass into the Alhafran Caves via the rear entrance.

 Anyway after the battle on the ship go the Alhafran jail. Here another 
scene takes place between Briggs and his family. Eoleo the youngest member 
of the family seems to be able to use Psynergy as well. After they leave 
"Mind Read" Briggs to confirm these thoughts if you will.


--Alhafran Cave (rear entrance)--
Hidden Items: 1 (50)
 Power Bread* - Check jar in Brigg's Cell
Chests: 6 (56)
 123 Coins, Ixion Mail, Lucky Medal, 777 Coins*, Potion*, Psy Crystal*
Monsters:
 Ghoul, Harpy, Ooze

 * = Reachable after Briggs' escape

 If you gave the Large Bread to the boy, you can enter the caves from the 
rear entrance (next to the Mayor's home). Inside there are some valuable 
treasures. From the entrance go down the stairs and go down the left path. 
In the next room use "Pound" and "Lash" to reach 3 treasure chests 
containing: 123 Coins, Ixion Mail and a Lucky Medal.

 Until Briggs escapes the other paths in this cave are a dead end, so leave 
if he is still in jail. After he does later on, the pillar will be removed 
allowing you to access some additional chests. Use "Frost" on the water 
puddle to reach three chests containing 777 Coins, a potion and a Psy 
Crystal. You can also get a Power Bread from the jar in his cell room.


--Madra--
 Now that Piers' innocence is proven, we might as well go back and check on 
him (or go to Air's Rock to get Reveal, if you haven't gotten that yet). 
Piers has left and the villagers now speak of the Kibombo tribe that 
attacked Madra. It is also the case that the Black Orb was stolen, a 
crucial item if you want to control a certain type of ship. You can enter 
the Madra Catacombs again, but you won't get much further than before. The 
Psynergy called "Frost" is required to complete this dungeon. If you have 
"Reveal" go towards the west on the world map, until you get to the 
Gondowan Cliffs (see Chapter 6).



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Revealing Lycanthropy of Wind Tribe
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can start at two places for this quest and we'll have to visit 5 places 
around here in order to do everything. So here is a brief summary:

Start at:
 1. South from Osenia Cliffs
 2. Southeastern exit of the Yampi Desert

Places to visit:
 1. Mikasalla (far south of the Osenia Cliffs)
 2. Osenia Cave (north-east of Mikasalla)
 3. World Map between Osenia Cave and Mikasalla (for a Mercury Djinni)
 4. Air's Rock (south of the Yampi Desert)
 5. Garoh (south east of Mikasalla & far south of Yampi Desert)

So I ordered the items in the order of the first starting point, but you 
can do it the other way around too.

--Mikasalla--
Inn:
 24 Coins
Hidden Items: 4 (60)
 Nut          - Wooden box near the lower left corner near a sheep
 Elixir       - Barrel in the lower right corner
 Herb         - Jar in the lower right home
 Lucky Pepper - Barrel inside the inn next to the oven
Chests: 1 (61)
 82 Coins     - Climb the first level of the tower, jump over to the right
                 and head up to the northern part of Mikasalla
Djinn:
 Mars - Spark (requires "Scoop")

 Buy some new armor here, because the enemies are getting stronger. Some 
of the people mention the tribe of the Garoh to the east. If you went 
through the desert already use "Scoop" in the center of the lower left 
corner (close to the chicken and the sheep) to dig out a ladder leading 
down. Enter it and eventually you'll reach a Mars Djinni in the backyard of 
the inn. It's quite a surprise to see that Spark joins you without a fight 
at all.

 If you are playing a Linked game (and you won the Colosso Event) Galahad 
the 3rd ranked gladiator from the Colosso event in Tolbi appears inside the 
inn. He asks if you know Isaac the knight, but it doesn't matter which 
answer you give. Galahad will tell Felix that the three fighters: Satrage, 
Navampa and Azart who were defeated by Isaac are out seeking revenge on 
them. 


--Osenia Cave West - World Map--
Djinn:
 Mercury - Sour

 There is a Mercury Djinni wandering around in the field between Mikasalla 
and Osenia Cave. Just walk around and Felix will meet him in battle. If 
your party is victorious in this battle you will get Mercury Djinni: Sour 
for free. It may be difficult to spot him, but he is located very close to 
the river bed

 Special: Cool, Douse, Frost, Froth, Ice, Escape
 Exp:     130
 Coins:   152
 Item: -


--Osenia Cave--
Stone Tablet:
 Megaera

 This cave can be found a little bit to the east of Mikasalla, it is 
located to the far north of it (use 'L' on the world map to get a better 
overview). Inside the cave use "Scoop" to open a passageway to the other 
side, walk up to the Stone Tablet and learn a new summon. Using 1 Mars and 
1 Jupiter Djinn to call up a new power: Megaera. Megaera is a fire 
elemental and also raises the ATK of all your allies after she is summoned.


--Garoh--
Inn:
 24 Coins
Hidden Items: 4 (65)
 Smoke Bomb    - Barrel next to the inn
 Elixir        - Jar inside the inn between two beds
 Nut           - Barrel upper left corner on the elevated section
 Sleep Bomb    - Blue jar inside the home in the upper left corner
Chests: 1 (66)
 Hypnos' Sword - After learning "Reveal" come back and use it on the six
                 platforms in the cave on the left side of town.
 Djinn:
  Jupiter - Ether

 Upon entering the town from the world map you have to climb some stairs in 
order to reach the actual homes of the people of Garoh. By the time you 
reach the top the day has turned into night. Further on you will hear some 
howls and the person belonging to those. A lycanthrope Werewolf will move 
along the path and back into the village.

 Some of the people of Garoh explain that they are the protectors of Air's 
Rock. They also claim that no such thing as werewolves exist. To continue 
our trip walk up the stairs in near the sanctuary and an old looking 
werewolf pops up from a crevice. He quickly disappears again, that is all 
we can do here for now as well, quite boring indeed. Oh well, our final 
destination for now is Air's Rock, which is close by from here. Just go to 
the north and walk into the purple rock in the center in the big desert 
area.


--Air's Rock (Exterior)--
Chests: 6 (72)
 Cookie, Fujin Shield, Sleep Bomb, Smoke Bomb, Storm Brand, Vial*
Monsters:
 Mimic, Creeper, Dino, Emu, Ghoul, Harpy, Kobold

  * = reachable after learning "Frost" 

 Take note that these type of dungeons are quite long, especially when 
compared to GS1 standards so make some time free. Also you can get Piers to
join you before you tackle this dungeon, but that does require more effort.
From the start walk up to the Wind Stone and cast "Whirlwind" on it. This
will amplify its power and removes the sand barrier blocking the passageway 
up ahead, then go left and take the lower left branch. Here you can use 
"Whirlwind" again to open southern path to a chest (it is not yet 
reachable). Go back to the branch and walk by the upper left way, until you 
reach a different chest. This is a mimic!
-------
Mimic 2

 HP:  431    ATK: 126    AGL:   77    Weak:    Fire
 PP:   36    DEF:  33    LCK:   16    Strong:  Wind
 Special: Debilitate, Psy Drain, Sleep, Tundra
 Exp:    272
 Coins:  241
 Item: Lucky Medal

 Fight it and after the battle you will receive a Lucky Medal for your 
troubles. Continue on and you'll reach another fork in the road. Follow the 
right route, at the next junction go right and use "Whirlwind" on the Wind 
Stone at top end of the screen. Run down all the way until you find another 
Wind Stone, cast "Whirlwind" on it, walk back a bit and navigate past the 
small pebbles around the left, then "Whirlwind" the Wind Stone TWICE to 
demolish both blockades. Walk back all the way to that chest and you can 
claim your Cookie (just follow the left wall).

 Follow the path to the south from here, at the bottom head towards the 
left, use "Whirlwind" on the rock while standing on its right side. Stroll 
back to the entrance, follow the left path and use the Psynergy again at 
the end. Felix can also claim a Smoke Bomb from the chest below here. Use 
the newly created path to reach a huge twister shaped purple rock; of 
course use "Whirlwind" on it. This will remove all the mud from the wall 
allowing you to climb it.

 On the next screen climb up two times using the leftmost route, then fall 
down and let yourself be guided by the small whirlwinds. Do this a second 
time and you will reach a brown pillar on the right side of the screen. 
Push it into position, walk on to the right, make another pillar fall, go 
over the closed gap and climb to down on the far right to the previous area 
to collect Storm Brand.

 Climb back up and ascend another two levels on the right, until you reach 
a dead end with a statue exhaling little whirlwinds to the left. Use one of 
these and climb down the cliff from the right edge, use another whirlwind 
trip to the left, climb up two more times, push the pillar down and use the 
whirlride to the left again. If you have Piers in your party you can use 
"Frost" on the pillar to the left, if you slide down. Then go to the start 
of this screen, climb up the wall and go to the right. You should be able 
to collect a Vial from the chest here.

 In the following area carefully climb past all the statues and do not get 
hit by the twisters or else you will have to start over again. Once you are 
at the top you can fall down the cliff here (don't worry), move another 
pillar to the right (creates a shortcut if you wish to go back sometime), 
collect a Sleep Bomb, stand on the statues mouth to get a free ride to the 
top again and go right to the next field.

 Here we have to climb up two times, move the left pillar one space to the 
left, climb down 1 level, run to the far right, fall down, use the whirl 
ride up, move the right pillar to the left fall, jump over the gap, fall 
down again and take the left whirlwind ride to the top. Exit to the left 
and ascend to another screen. Here it is quite foggy and the only thing you 
can at this moment is moving the pillar in the gap with "Move" Psynergy. Go 
back two screens, fall down two times and use the left route to get back to 
the purple whirl rock. Use "Whirlwind" on it and we can finally get to the 
top of Air's Rock, but don't think we are done yet! We actually have to 
begin. BTW: if you can afford some time go back and use the right route to 
climb all the walls to get 1 chest with a Fujin Shield. It is worth your 
troubles since it has +50(!) Wind Resistance, but still I think it is evil 
of the developers to make you run around all over the place so many times.


--Air's Rock (Interior)--
Chests: 6 (78)
 Elixir, 666 Coins, Clarity Circlet, Psy Crystal, Vial(2x)
Stone Tablet:
 Flora
Monsters:
 Creeper, Dino, Emu, Ghoul, Harpy, Kobold, Mummy

 Anyway once you reached the top following the left route use "Whirlwind" 
on the twister rock here to open a new road leading to the interior of 
Air's Rock. Inside there is only one path. There is nothing useful we can 
do here so go to the next room. Felix will be standing on a tile marked 
with two yellow dots for reference. Go through the door on the right, 
follow the right upper path, use "Pound" on the right grey pillar once and 
move the brown pillars in such a way that we have the following setup:

                          B
                        G B _ G _ B

  _ = Empty Space 
  G = Grey Cone Pillar
  B = Brown Pillar

 Jump on the upper left brown pillar and go over to the other side, use 
"Whirlwind" on the rock and it should hit the wall, because we left the 
left cone pillar untouched. Walk back, go through that new passage, cast 
"Whirlwind" on the wind Stone back here, move the pillar behind the section 
we just opened up and walk around using the pillar as a stepping stone to 
reach a door with three red dots.

 Move to the upper right corner of this "Three Red Dots" room and "Move" 
the pillar one space to the right, in order to walk past the non-venting 
gap. Further to the north use "Move" to push the pillar to the right, walk 
past the non-venting shaft and you are very close to the pillar again. 
Stand one space to the right of it, "Move" the pillar away from you, this 
way Felix can jump over it after ascending to the elevated level. Keep on 
following the left path and push a pillar one space to the right so another 
ventilation shaft gets unblocked on the elevated section. Go back to the 
lowered section in the middle, push a pillar down two squares in order to 
be able to traverse over it on the higher level. After doing so slide down 
and climb up again. Felix can safely walk past the shaft here, follow the 
path and you'll be back in the big room again.

 Hop over to the passage on the left marked with "Three Blue Dots". In here 
use "Whirlwind" Psynergy on the stone, while standing on its right side. 
This will cause a wall segment to rotate so you can walk over it, then 
follow the left route and use your Psynergy again on the rock so the wall 
in now aligned vertically. Go back to the junction and pick the other path, 
before going over that wall part. Here Felix can push a pillar in the gap 
so we have a shortcut if you ever wish to come back here. You can exit here 
to a room marked with "Four Blue Dots".

 Go left here to find a chest with an Elixir as minor treasure. Follow the 
upper route in this room and eventually you will reach another rock on 
which you can use Psynergy. Do so and walk over the tightrope to the north, 
once you're on the other side use "Whirlwind" again to make the wall appear 
horizontal again. Walk over it towards the left, DON'T fall down the slide 
here or else you have to do the previous thing all over again. Instead jump 
over to the brown pillar and continue past some more gaps.

 Again back in the big chamber again descend to the bottom level using the 
wall. Inside a crystallized room you may touch the Psynergy rock to 
replenish PP, but that is not very important at the moment. Finally we can 
activate all the statues in this place by using your well-known Psynergy on 
the purple twister rock around here. Use the small face to the south to get 
a free trip back to one of the first rooms.

 In here use "Whirlwind" to activate the statues in this room, "Move" the 
pillar on the left so you can walk around here. You should now easily be 
able to reach the Vial in the chest on the right. Exit this room via the 
doorway on the left side. Back in the main room again we can go two 
directions:
    1. Right for a Summon Tablet
    2. Left for completing this dungeon.
So I split the thing up with a small intermezzo, so you know where to go 
from here.

Summon Tablet
-------------
 Go right and continue on until you reach the "Three Red Dots" room. 
Remember the lone brown pillar in the center that didn't seem to have any 
use the last time we went past it? Well, we are going to use it now. Push 
it 1 square to the right, then go all the way to the north and use the 
activated statue to reach the left ledge. Use "Whirlwind" on the rock while 
looking to the south so the pillar is transported along with it. From here 
on I think it is rather easy to get the Summon: Flora. It requires 2 
Jupiter and 1 Venus Djinn to call her. Next to that her secondary ability 
is to put enemies asleep.
------------

 Take the left route through the door and push a pillar two spots to the 
right before taking the air ride to the other side. Jump over to the north, 
push the statue to the most northern tile and use a whirl to get to the 
chest with a Clarity Circlet. Push the statue down again, use the 
whirlwinds (you can create another shortcut with the pillar here too), 
follow the left path, jump around, "Move" the brown pillar to the left to 
unblock a ventilation shaft. Our hero can exit this room using the stairs 
just to the right.

 Still not reached the final room, *sigh*, these dungeons are so much 
bigger as in the original game. At least it keeps you off the streets. 
Anyway, just walk over some tightropes and you'll reach the "Four Blue 
Dots" room. Use "Whirlwind" on the rock here from both west and north 
sides, so you can collect your 666 Coins... Told you the developers are 
evil. Before exiting this room, don't forget about the pillar a little 
further on.

 In the "Five Blue Dots" room (there are no enemies in this room) follow 
the western path in order to obtain another Vial. Go to the north here, 
"Move" the statue to the right, this allows Felix to walk over the right 
path safely. Back in the main room use the free whirl ride to the right. 
Climb up the wall here and the rest is easy from here on.

 After entering the center room, jump over some stepping stones that seem 
to disappear once you get past them and investigate the stone tablet around 
here. Sheba pops up and learns "Reveal" from the inscriptions (Hmmm... no 
boss fight or anything). Best of all there are no Psynergy objects required 
that clutter up your inventory. From here take the left route and use your 
newly acquired Psynergy to get a Psy Crystal. Then take the right route and 
go back to the main room.

 We can exit this place via either one of the following two paths: the 
front (the way which we came by) or the back door. This second path is 
found at the very lower right corner of the bottom floor of the main room. 
Also you can just use Felix's "Retreat" to get back very quickly. Now what 
else can we do with "Reveal"? Go back to Garoh, that's what.


--Garoh--
 Back in Garoh again, use "Reveal" on the big rock to the right of the 
sanctuary. A crevice opens up and inside the party meets a small werewolf. 
Kraden, the old man, gets very excited and wants to continue on. Do so by 
following the upper left route. All the members of the group appear here 
and finally the werewolves show up using the "Reveal" formula as well. Some 
explanations are made and Maha tells you to come back later. After sleeping 
in the inn, all the werewolves have turned back into their human forms 
again, because it is daytime now. After going back to Maha during daytime 
he will give you the Jupiter Djinni: Ether.
 Also using "Reveal" on the six platforms inside the cavern on the left of 
town opens a path to a chest with the Hypnos' Sword. That's all for this 
chapter. Go back to the western entrance of the Yampi Desert (in order to 
complete 4A and 4B), or if Piers is already set free continue at Chapter 6.

6. The Witch-doctor's Consecration
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Gondowan Cliffs--
Hidden Items: 3 (81)
 Sleep Bomb, Laughing Fungus, Healing Fungus
Djinn:
 Mars - Kindle
Monsters:
 Wild Gorilla, Wolfkin Cub, Wyvern Chick

 Optionally, go to the left at the start, "Whirlwind" the foliage and 
enter the cave to find some Kibombo Warriors. Something is definitely going 
here. Back at the entrance "Mind read" the dog to get a free hint! Use 
"Scoop" on the yellow sand to make a small geyser appear. Stand on it to 
reach the left of the field. There are some mushrooms growing around here, 
but we can't collect them at this moment so leave them be.

 Continue on to the left (there is only one path) until you reach three 
slides from which you can fall down. The Left and Right slides lead you 
back to the where you started, hence take the Center slide. Jump over the 
gap, use "Move" on the small pillar to the left and push it into the water. 
This creates the extra step we need to get past this screen. Walk back, 
fall down the slide here too, climb down another vine, jump over the rocks 
and climb up the next vine. The jumping field you come across here may be a 
bit difficult to navigate through for some people so here's a short list of 
movements starting from the first tile:

               LLLLU ULuUl LuLlD DLuUU URRdR RUUULL 

        L = Jump Left
        U = Jump Up
        R = Jump Right
        D = Jump Down
  l,u,r,d = move one tile left, up, right or down

 After climbing back onto the main land, head up, climb a vine, jump over 
the gap you just walked underneath, climb a third vine and collect the 
Smoke bomb from the chest. Go back, climb down the lower left vine and 
continue on to the north. Here you will pass by a tightrope to the west. 
Take it if you want to exit, or go right and eventually you'll reach an 
aggressive Mars Djinni. Time to do some battle:

 Stun / Sleep him so he won't be able to run away or attack you, other than 
that it should not be too difficult all the same. After he had enough 
Kindle will most certainly aid you in your quest.

 If you like Felix can collect the red mushroom called 'Laughing Fungus' 
over to the right. It is a useless item actually, but for the collectors it 
may be interesting as well. Anyway, head back to the far west and use the 
tightrope to get you back to Gondowan; the same continent where we started 
in the Venus Lighthouse.


--Naribwe far south - World map--

 Unicorn Ring - See description below
Chests: 1 (86)
 Thorn Crown  - Use "Lash" on rope on the right of the screen

 For the Unicorn Ring do the following: Go to the upper left corner using 
the house there to reach the backyard. Use "Whirlwind" to make the ivy 
overgrowth disappear, climb the ladder appearing underneath and use 
"Reveal" on the stone to get a Unicorn Ring.

 This small desert town is populated by a few native people. One of them 
tells you that back when Oeia (that an original name!) was the Kibombo 
Witch-doctor their tribe was much more peaceful, but after Akafubu took 
over things went different. It sounds like there is definitely something 
going on to the north. A Witch-doctor in a hut can tell your fortune for 20 
coins. Most of the items you can show him give a default answer, but the 
Shaman's Rod seems to be different from the pack. Head to the north towards 
the Kibombo Mountain range.


--Kibombo Mountains--
Hidden Items: 2 (88)
 Smoke Bomb - Check right wooden box in cavern on the second screen
 Bone       - Use "Tremor" on the chest it is lying (DON'T pick it up;
              you can't get rid of it!)
Chests: 3 (91)
 Power Bread, Tear Stone, Disk Axe
Djinni:
 Jupiter - Waft
Monsters:
 Assassin, Dirge, Pixie, Wild Gorilla

 If you get close to the actual entrance some Kibombo warriors show up. 
Start working very carefully, because if a Kibombo warrior sees Felix you 
will have to start all over again. Go right and place the big crates in 
such a way you can jump over them after climbing up the vine. Once you're 
past this climb another vine, walk over to the left, push the pillar in the 
gap (creates a shortcut) and continue on. 

 Walk up behind the crate here, and make sure the Kibombo bloke doesn't see 
you. Push the crate to the right (your enemy doesn't notice a moving 
crate..?). Don't climb down on the other side or he will see you. You can 
get the Disk Axe by falling down the slide a little further on to the right 
from the chest. Use "Move" to get the crate here to the very left so you 
can climb the vine without being caught. Once you are back up again use 
"Lash" on the rope. Go down if you wish to create a shortcut that may come 
in handy later on, else head up along the tight edge.

 On the next screen you can collect the Power Bread from the chest, but in 
order to do so you need to make the crate fall on top of the Kibombo guy 
the moment he is right beneath the edge. Beware of the dog around here, if 
he sees you he'll alert the other Warriors! So don't let him see you. Drop 
the pillar to trap the dog on either side; if you trap him in the upper 
part you can collect the Tear Stone from the chest. Go back one screen to 
do this over again so we can move on by trapping him/her on the other side. 

 Inside the cavern there is a Smoke bomb hidden in the wooden crate (I knew 
it! They are terrorists). Outside the pillar is back up again like magic, 
so you need to use "Tremor" on the crate to the right to make the bone drop 
on the floor. This keeps the dog occupied for as long as you stay on that 
screen. Cast "Whirlwind" on the overgrowth to open up a small cavern, 
continue along, go outside again, climb up and down some vines and you'll 
see a Jupiter Djinni around here. As expected, we cannot get to him so we 
have to leave him be; jump over the river and continue on the left exit. On 
the world map just head north and everything is getting dark all of a 
sudden, there must be something going on at Kibombo!


--Kibombo--
Inn: 
  48 Coins*

 Lucky Medal  - In the blue jar inside back room of upper left home*
Djinn:

 Mercury - Shade    (Piers' pet)

 * = after consecration event is completed

 The single person standing at the bottom of town tells you that Akafubu may 
not be the true witchdoctor, because the Gabomba statue doesn't open its 
mouth. After getting this interesting information, it is time to go to the 
consecration to the north. We can't reach the statue by conventional 
walking, because all those people are in your way. Therefore use "Lash" on 
the rope in the lower left corner of the village, jump over all the poles 
and work your way around until you reach the 'dead end' near the water 
puddle. It is actually not a dead end, for you can simply step on the roof 
of the home a little below here! This way we can still reach the left side. 
It is time to meet up with a very special person. The fourth and final 
member of the team!

 But first watch the cut scene where Akafubu tries to make the statue's 
mouth open up using the Black Orb as a sacrifice (nice hairstyle!). After 
this, walk up and meet with Piers, indeed he is the final Adept who 
remained a mystery for so long. Piers seems to be in trouble for he cannot 
reach the Black Orb; the reason for which he came here. So it is up to 
Felix to lend a hand with "Move". After some talking the Mercury Adept 
joins you (without a fight), bringing in Spring and Shade Djinn as pets! 
Lastly, being a mercury adept means that Piers has "Frost" Psynergy,
something we will need quite often in the future to complete the other
quests. It turns out that he is a Lemurian and that is something that
excites Kraden very much, but now is not the time for stories. It is your
mission to reclaim the Black Orb from Akafubu.

 Walk around a bit and it seems to be a dead end. Of course the viewer has 
already noticed the markings on the ground; you know what to do next, or 
actually Felix does it for you. After some more talking they come to the 
conclusion that there is a ventilation shaft around here. Indeed, after you 
use "Scoop" on the left patch you just came by the path to the Gabomba 
Statue is opened.


--Gabomba Statue--
Hidden Items: 1 (95)
 Black Orb - Retrieve it from the inner Gabomba Statue's lap
Chests: 2 (97)
 Bone Armlet, Elixir
Djinn:
 Venus - Steel
Monsters:
 Mimic, Bone Fighter, Death Head, Doomsayer, Red Demon*, Salamander, Spirit

        * = rarely drops Staff of Anubis

 Walk around, climb the stairs and you'll be forced through the rotating 
pinions. In the next room head up to the horizontal corridor, then follow 
the lower wall and you'll reach a Mimic!

Mimic 3

 Item: Hard Nut

 Go down the third corridor from the right to reach a chest with Bone 
Armlet. The rightmost path leads to the next room. Walk around the 
cogwheels, then use "Lash" on the rope to make all the gears stop. This 
allows you to reach the ladder on the right side of the room and ascend one 
floor. There is not much to do here at this moment, so go up another set
of ladders.

 Walk around in this room, if you try to walk to the far left a little 
mouse pops up and it will show you some interesting moves. Felix can use 
the cogs to hop around the place too. Head further to the left and go down 
two rooms, head down, take the leftmost path in order to continue on and 
use "Pound" on the cone pillar next to the flashing cog.

 Retrace your steps back to the room where you saw the mouse, follow the 
same route as he did and you'll end up on the right side of this room. 
Descend 2 floors, take the left route for an elixir and use the right to 
get to the flashing cog again. "Pound" the other pillar as well and all the 
cogs start to rotate into the other direction! Go back two rooms again, go 
to the center and use the left pink cog to fall down one room and crash 
into a Venus Djinni.

 Item: -
After a quick battle Earth Djinni Steel comes along, this should give
you 5 Mercury Djinn and 3 Djinn of the other types. This allows him to 
summon Boreas. Use "Lash" to get out of this position and back to the 
previous room. This time go up the ladder near the bottom part of the room. 
Go through the pinions, climb another ladder to reach a very strange room 
with a small Gabomba Statue in the middle. 

 Ascend yet another level and a small cut scene takes place. It turns out 
to be that Felix and the other have reached the eyes of the statue, outside 
the jewel is again presented to the statue. Kraden notices that the flow of 
energy is stuck, so Felix has to solve a puzzle in order to remove the 
disturbance. Hence the objective is to make 1 blue and 1 red spark reach 
the head in the center of the room.

 This puzzle is randomized per game, therefore I can't give straight
directions. It shouldn't be to hard to solve in any case. Here's some
general directions:

 -First use "Pound" on the grey cone; this will raise all the tiles
 -Step on the arrow tile to rotate all remaining floating tiles
 -Look for a path so there are paths towards the goal for both gullies
 -Use "Pound" to bring down each individual tile and rotate the others
  if needed, before pounding those down as well

After completing this puzzle the statue stretches its tongue and devours 
the Black Orb, after this Akafubu enters the statue as well. Piers and the 
others see how the Orb passes by, but they do not even try to get it before 
it vanishes into the hole (it looks rather silly when this happens).

 After some talking with the Witch-Doctor a.k.a. Afro-man, he will retrieve 
the orb for you. Better follow him to make sure he keeps his promise. Try 
to pick up the Orb in the back room and the statue starts to speak. He 
grants Akafubu the rank of Witch-Doctor, but Akafubu is so caught up with 
himself that he leaves before the statue gives him his treasure. When the 
statue is done talking Felix can get the Orb for free, if you paid any 
attention you know that you have to talk to Akafubu before you can claim 
your prize here!
 

--Kibombo--
 After speaking to Akafubu and his father you can walk around as you 
please. Don't forget to buy the Frost Wand. It's a very good weapon for 
Sheba. You might want to go back to the Gabomba statue and you can as its 
tongue is still sticking out so you can easily enter (doesn't that make it 
dry out?). Unfortunately we have to come back here some time later as well! 
Things like these make it quite complicated sometimes to write a good 
comprehensive walkthrough with all this backtracking...

 There are quite a lot of places that we can explore using Piers' "Frost" 
as you may remember from all the water puddles we have come across. 
You might better wait for a moment and get the ship back first. This way
you will also obtain "Cyclone" Psynergy which allows us to complete all 
optional events in one go. Hence we first go back to Piers' ship located 
near Madra.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Out to the open sea
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Kibombo Mountains--
 If you enter from the west you can use "Frost" right away on the puddle on 
the third level. Use this icy pillar then equip a Mars Djinni to Felix or a 
Venus Djinni to Jenna so you can use "Growth" on the plant. Use it to reach 
a Jupiter Djinni named Waft.

without having to sneak around.


--Naribwe--
 Visiting the fortuneteller Witch-doctor and showing him any item and gives 
you the following hint: "You must forge a weapon to defeat a mortal enemy. 
Seek out the pieces!". This is indeed a very vague hint, but it will become 
clear later on.


--Gondowan Cliffs--
 After entering from the left side use "Frost" on the puddle to the far 
right, climb the vine, jump over the gap using the icy pillar, fall down 
the slide, then collect the Healing Fungus for free. Pay a visit to the old 
man in Madra (in the biggest home) and he'll trade it for Char the Mars 
Djinni.
 

--East Indra Shore--
 Upon entering this location (a ship on the world map) with Piers and the 
Orb a small conversation takes place; Piers is willing to take everybody 
with him to Lemuria, but before he does so he wants to see the mayor of 
Madra. This is actually a good thing, since we need to get an item there. 
Make sure to use "Frost" on the puddle to the left here and collect a
Cookie from the wooden box. 


--Madra--
 When you try to approach the Mayor's residence a young woman with red hair 
and equally colored dark eyes shows up. She is calling out for her sister 
Menardi. Talking and Mind Reading her doesn't seem to help, albeit she 
clearly senses your Psynergetic powers. Talk to the mayor and eventually 
you will get the Cyclone Chip, which allows you to use "Cyclone" Psynergy. 
The moment the mayor leaves and thanks Felix as the young woman turns to 
the party members. She recognizes that name as one of Menardi's companions,
so she asks about her whereabouts.

 After some more talking Menardi's sister says that she, Karst, will avenge 
her sister. Her number one priority is taking care of Felix, hence she 
won't help out on lighting the Jupiter Lighthouse somewhere in the western 
sea. After Karst leaves some more talking has to be done before you can 
start playing again. Notice how Jenna's color turns, when Sheba makes 
suggestive remarks about her and Isaac.

 Coins:  169
 Item:   -

This battle is hardly more difficult than the one in Golden Sun. So after a 
very short battle they should be done for. Your reward for this optional 
linked battle are the Golden Boots.


--East Indra Shore--
 Back again for the third time here, you can finally board the ship. If you 
didn't use "Frost" on the puddle outside do so now, for this will be the 
last chance to reach the Cookie that I mentioned earlier on. The final part 
is to get the main engine running again. Of course this will be more 
difficult than just switching the power button to 'On'.


--Lemurian Ship--
Hidden Items: 3 (101)
 Elixir - Check lower left barrel in the first room
 Antidote - Check the upper left wooden box in the rightmost room.
 Oil Drop - Check the barrel on the upper level in the room of Aqua Hydra 
Chests: 2 (102)
 Potion, Mist Potion*
Enemies:
 Aqua Jelly, Conch Shell
Boss:
 Aqua Hydra

 * = reachable after learning "Parch" and docking the boat
     in Lemuria or Atteka Inlet

 Inside go down one level and beat up both Aqua Jellies, then freeze the
water puddle the second Aqua Jelly leaves with "Frost". This allows you 
to reach a chest containing a Potion. Continue down the lower set of stairs,
move along three rooms until you reach a room with a movable crate and 6 
Aqua Jellies. Destroy the lowest two, freeze the puddles and move the crate
in between. Jump over to the other side and exit this room. Go to the next 
room where you have to repeat the process of beating all jellies and using 
the frozen puddles to reach the upper left exit in that room (don't forget 
to move the crate in this room one square down and then one to the left). 
There is also an Antidote in the wooden box here.

 After some more walking you'll reach an Aqua Jelly that gets scared of 
you. Let him escape to the lower level, go down the ladder and attack him 
on the lower level. After his defeat use "Frost" to make certain the 
moveable platform stays up, instead of falling down every time you step on 
it. Continue on and check the barrel in the following room to find an Oil 
Drop. Go down one level and touch the Aqua Jelly. Instead of fighting you 
on its own it merges with the other Jellies into an Aqua Hydra!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Aqua Hydra
----------------
 HP: 2276   ATK: 173    AGL: 63      Weak:    Fire
 PP:   70   DEF:  38    LCK: 44      Strong:  Water
 Special: Drench, Raging Flood, Rising Venom, Slaver, Triple Chomp
 Exp.:    963
 Coins:  1612
 Item:   Vial

This boss has quite some HP so prepare for a longer battle than usual. His 
attacks are not really devastating and of course good fire based attacks 
have much effect on him. I reckon that this boss should not cause too much 
problems.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 After you beat this goon the water floods the entire lower level, causing 
you to miss a chest. This was meant intentionally by the programmers, yo 
can however claim the item much later on when we reach Lemuria. Take the 
upper left exit and continue on to the lowest part of the ship. Here you 
have to use "Douse" on the right pillar in order to fill it with water. 
Next push it on to the tile marked by a water droplet. Walk through the 
corridor and you'll reach the engine room. Inside Piers will activate the 
main engine and the ship can set out to the open sea!


--Eastern Sea--
Hidden Items: 2 (105)
 Rusty Mace - Examine the light mark (See location on the map below)
 Rusty Axe  - Examine the light mark (See location on the map below)

Your current mission is to go to Lemuria, but there is so much to do that I 
will split up the walkthrough in smaller parts, because the plot is no 
longer linear from here on. Just below here is the world map with all the 
new (and interesting) locations that can be reached.

20. Treasure Island

 I'll try to represent all the locations in the most logical order and also 
the easiest, because some locations have enemies that are too strong for 
your current party. The initial mission is to get to Lemuria; however you 
cannot reach that straightaway. We can go to chapter 9 and start to collect 
the parts of weapon that we need to continue on, because an initial attempt 
to reach Lemuria will fail. There are also some optional events that can be 
cleared in the chapter below here. You can also visit each place right now 
to map them and to get some of the interesting easy to reach items like the 
Gold Ring from Champa (in a Linked Game).



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Optional Side-quests
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Check the map a little above and you will see that there is a vast amount 
of locations to explore. Most of them are optional or are required to be 
completed in a later stage of the game. Therefore I will provide a path 
through all the locations in the most optimal way, however since there are 
so many optional parts I will go through these first. This way people who 
wish to continue on with the actual quest to get to Lemuria can simply skip 
this part and read chapter 9. So without further ado, here are all the 
things that can be cleared up to now.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
8A. Going back to the Gabomba Statue
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Kibombo--
 Using the boat you can easily get to Kibombo without having to go through 
the cliffs and the mountain range. So quickly head to the statue and go 
down all the way, until you reach the catacombs.

--Gabomba Catacombs--
Hidden Items: 2 (107)
 Mint           - see below
 Tomegathericon - Gift from the Gabomba Statue
Djinn:
 Venus Djinni - Mud
Monsters:
  Mad Plant, Bone Fighter, Death Head, Doomsayer, Mad Plant, Red Demon,
  Salamander, Spirit

 Go to the lower level right away walk up via the right wall. You reach a 
dead end here, because the rocks are blocking your path to a large patch of 
bushes. Use "Cyclone" here and you will trigger a 'teleporter' stone that 
is hidden to your north. Felix will be transported one level down and here 
you can catch a Venus Djinni in plain sight. Indeed, it wants to fight with 
you.
------------
Venus Djinni

 HP:  500     ATK: 153     AGL: 122       Weak:    Wind
 PP:   44     DEF:  41     LCK:  15       Strong:  Earth
 Special: Briar, Gaia, Mad Growth, Spire, Quake Sphere, Escape
 Exp:     360
 Coins:   358
 Item: -

 After this battle Mud will join your party and you should have at least 
four Djinn of each type. Fall down the slide and go back up the stairs. Go 
a bit to the south and use "Cyclone" to uncover another teleporter stone, 
which sends you to down one level, but at a different location. Follow the 
right wall and in the next room unveil Mint with "Cyclone" from the bushes. 
Climb down the ladder to the north and use the Psynergy again on the five 
bushes to reveal a water puddle. As expected, use "Frost" on it, go over 
the new passageway to reach another dead end and cast "Reveal" on the wall 
here in order to continue on.

 Walk up over the water stream to the other side, when you reach it 
carefully look for a gap covered by a long pole in the water. You walk 
behind it and reach the area that lies behind it. Reuse this trick two more 
times and you should be in the upper left part of this room. Use "Cyclone" 
& "Frost" combination again, so you can reach the stairway in the center of 
the screen.

 You have nearly reached the end of this cavern; use "Cyclone" one more 
time on the group of bushes to uncover the first of five Mad Plants in this 
game.

Mad Plant 1

 HP:  449     ATK: 181     AGL:  87       Weak:    Fire
 PP:    0     DEF:  41     LCK:  19       Strong:  Water
 Special:  Poisonous Bite
 Exp:     321
 Coins:   347
 Item: Game Ticket


 Defeat it from some Exp and then walk up to the Gabomba Statue. The statue 
speaks to you and gives you the 'Tomegathericon'. Either walk back or use 
"Retreat" to get out of this place.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
8B. Exploring the Taopo Swamp & Blacksmith Sunshine (Optional)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Yallam--
Inn:
 64 Coins
Hidden Items: 5 (112)
 Elixir   - Check wooden box in the inn
 16 Coins - Jar outside the inn on the left side
 Antidote - Use "Cyclone" on the two bushes on the upper level
 Nut      - Use "Cyclone" on the bushes in the lower right corner
 Oil Drop - Upper right barrel in Sunshine's shop 
Chests: 1 (112)
 Masamune (Only reachable after Isaac joins AND Orb of Force is linked)

 Here in Yallam you can meet the local blacksmith called Sunshine. He is 
usually lying on his bed waiting for new material to be brought to him so 
he can forge it for the right price. In order to complete the forging 
process you just need to leave the village and reenter from the World Map. 
That's all there is to it. He can forge the items as listed in the table

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 From Yallam take the northern exit and head to the west, go south over the 
bridge and you'll reach the swamp. This dungeon is optional, but it has 
some nice items. The enemies around there are weaker than in the dungeons 
that follow so this allows you to gain some extra experience, before having 
to take on the adversaries that have yet to come.

--Taopo Swamp--
Hidden Items: 4 (117)
 Tear Drop    - Use "Scoop" on the lowest level of the eastern dungeon.
 Tear Drop    - Use "Scoop" on the lowest level of the western dungeon.
 Star Dust    - Use "Scoop" on the lowest level of the center dungeon.
 Bramble Seed - Use "Cyclone" on bushes inside east entrance
Chests: 2 (118)
 Cookie, Vial
Djinn:
 Venus - Flower
Monsters:
 Mad Plant, Cave Troll, Death Cap, Dire Wolf, Faery, Ghost Mage, 
 Mad Vermin, Undead

 There is not much to do on the first screen so go to the next and use 
"Move" on the small pillar towards you so it disappears. Use "Whirlwind" on 
the distinct overgrowth to the left and inside the cave use "Scoop" to 
collect a Tear Stone. Go outside again and check out the swampy area to the 
right. When you step on mud you will gradually sink with each step into the 
mud, but if you touch some bubbles you will regain your height again.

 With this in mind go from start to the first bubble down, then walk to the 
left (twice), down, left and down-left. From here on go to the south 
because you won't make it to the western shoreline. At this bubble go left 
up the stairs, get a Cookie from the chest and return to the previous 
scene.

 From here follow the path of bubbles to the lower right corner. Ascend 
the stairs again and use "Whirlwind" on the overgrowth in order to blow 
it away. Go inside, downstairs, and run past the ventilation shafts with 
care. If you fall down here you can find a bramble seed hidden in the 
foliage. Anyway, get past those blowers and walk around the room to the far 
right, until you come across another Djinni. Use "Move" on the pillar so 
the ventilation hole gets covered, this will cause a gust to blow against 
the Venus Djinni making him fall down one level so follow him via the 
second slide to your right. Jump over to the Djinni for a battle (is it me 
or are the Djinn in this game a lot less willing to cooperate?)

 HP:  590     ATK: 182     AGL: 149       Weak:    Wind

 Coins: 432 
 Item: -

 After a victory in battle Flower will serve you and adds his power to 
yours. If you use "Cyclone" on the leftmost bush on the lower floor a Mad 
Plant will appear! Beating it yields a Lucky Medal as reward.

 Item: Lucky Medal

 Get back up one level and go through the passageway to the north. The path 
will eventually lead to a place where a Tear Drop is hidden somewhat in the 
ground. Use "Scoop" to collect it. Go back outside and use "Growth" (i.e. 
equip a Mars Djinni to Felix) continue on and use "Whirlwind" on another 
piece of foliage covering another hole. Inside the cave again follow the 
path, until you reach a dead end. There appears to be a strange circular 
shaped spot on the ground. If you use "Douse" on it and then quickly 
"Frost" before the air stream blows the water away you can continue on to 
the west.

 Follow the path down, until you reach a room filled with lava. Use "Douse" 
on the red glowing rock to cool it down. Next push into the lava and 
finally use it as a stepping stone to reach the bottom of the room. In the 
next room jump on the pillar and quickly get past the upper left section, 
when the air stream stops. Go to the lower left corner and use "Douse" & 
"Move" on the rock to get to the chest with a Vial. Get back to the upper 
right corner and use the Psynergy combination again to exit this room from 
a different passageway.
 
 When you get back into the previous room use "Tremor" on the pillar with a 
huge rock on top of it. Doing this will open up a new passageway for you to 
explore. You know what to do with the red rock that appears so continue on 
to the north and down the stairs. Use "Douse" again on another rock to turn 
the lights out and then push it out of your way.

 Go clockwise around the next room and you'll reach the final chamber of 
this mini-dungeon. Cool the rock down again and a light will become visible 
in the darkness. Use "Scoop" on it to uncover some Star Dust. Go back all 
the way, until you reach a rope. You can use "Lash" on it and exit the 
swamp, or just use "Retreat" to get the job done much quicker. You might as 
well go to Yallam now, because you can use the raw material to forge some 
random new armor and weapons.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
8C. Animal Trade Quest (Optional)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The trade quest will eventually help you in finding a very powerful new 
Summon, so it is worth your troubles. We start at East Tundaria Islet, 
which is a small island covered with snow to the far south near the 
entrance to the frozen continent of Tundaria.

--E Tundaria Islet--
Hidden Items: 2 (121)
 Lucky Medal  - Check the blue left jar inside the hut
 Pretty Stone - Save Pengulina

"Mind Read" the penguin to find out that his girlfriend has hurt her leg 
and cannot swim back. So you jump over all the moving ice bergs in order to 
push the wooden log into the water. This way she can walk back to safety, 
that is you have to push her back to her boyfriend. For your efforts of 
saving Pengulina the male penguin gives you a 'Pretty Stone'.


--SE Angara Islet--
Hidden Items: 2 (123)
 Lucky Medal - Check the wooden box in the lower right corner of the screen
 Red Cloth   - Trade with the bird for the Pretty Stone

 Talking to the 2 suspicious persons yields a hint about Treasure Island, 
but again that is a location beyond reach. Notice the two small boxes 
around this area. First use "Move" on the highest located one to get it to 
the lowest level and move it towards the water puddle on the left. Place it 
so that it is two squares away from it. Freeze the puddle with "Frost", 
push the other small crate onto it, you can climb the vines and reach a 
bird's nest. If you get close to it the bird will get back onto its nest. 
If you "Mind read" it you will get to hear that the bird wants something to 
make it look extra fancy. If you have the pretty stone from the penguin 
then the bird exchanges it for a very fancy Neckerchief a.k.a. Red Cloth.


--N Osenia Islet--
Hidden Items: 2 (125)
  Lucky Medal - Check the leftmost barrel inside the lonely home
  Milk        - Trade the Red Scarf for this item with the Cow

After you get "Sand" Psynergy from Gaia Rock you can reach the cow in the 
backyard. "Mind read" the cow and she will trade the scarf for some fresh 
produced Milk. That's all for this place.


--West Indra Islet--
Hidden Items: 2 (127)
 Lucky Medal - Check barrel on the pier near the upper left corner
 Li'l Turtle - Trade the Milk for the turtle with the Dog

The dog in the water complains about the salty water and would like to 
drink something more juicy. The milk that the cow gave you is very useful 
right now. He trades it for a little turtle he found in the water called 
Li'l Turtle.


--Sea of Time Islet--
Hidden Items: 1 (128)
 Lucky Medal - Check the barrel in the left corner outside the only hut

 There is not much to do here. You can "Mind Read" the turtle for a hint 
why he seems so sad. He feels lonely and needs a friend, so give him Li'l 
turtle and Lonesome George has a friend now. He doesn't have another trade 
for you, but instead he shows you his secret spot. This location will be 
very valuable as it contains some good items.

--Islet Cave--
Chests: 2 (130)
 Turtle Boots, Rusty Staff (forges in Dracomace)
Djinn:
 Venus - Meld
Monsters:
 Dinox, Harridan, Magicore, Squirrelfang, Stone Soldier

 For the moment we can only discover a few rarities around here. The Turtle 
boots can be located on the left side of the water. Take the exit to the 
right, ride across the water then go down, and use the log to ride all the 
way up to a Venus Djinni, who will fight you of course. After combat Meld 
will be a new addition to your pets, I mean Djinn inventory.

 Take the upper left passage and you'll reach another log in the water, at 
the other side you can find a Rusty Staff (Dracomace). Exit this place and 
come back when you have "Teleport" for some more fun!

9. Collect the Trident Parts
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As mentioned in chapter 7 it is impossible to reach Lemuria, by going 
through the Sea of Time as you currently are equipped. Even if you manage 
to get past the Sea of Time itself using the route given by the children of 
Yallam (see 10.1) you will meet your demise at the hand of Poseidon; the 
Levantine. He is gifted with a force field which will nullify ANY attack 
that is launched on him, thus rendering any attempt to eliminate him 
futile. If you have been listening to some of the hints given by various 
people like the Naribwe Witchdoctor you will know that you need to find a 
Trident weapon in order to overcome your problems.

 This Trident however is split up in three different parts. So we first 
need to collect these and then forge them. Because it is possible to attain 
any of three parts in any random order I split the walkthrough up in three 
parts: Right Prong (9A), Center Prong (9B) & Left Prong (9C). I follow this 
order, because on this route the enemies will gradually grow stronger so 
this should be the easiest route to traverse through.

 After acquiring all three parts (or actually after getting the Burst 
Brooch) you can complete some parts of chapter 10. Our first and easiest 
task is to claim the Right Prong from the Shrine of the Sea God. As a 
final note I'd like to point out that for any of you who have skipped 
Air's Rock, you'd better go there right now. Because you really need 
"Reveal" to get any of the three Trident parts!



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
9A. Backtrack to the Sea God's Shrine (Right Prong)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Daila--
 Inside the shrine use "Frost" on the two leftmost puddles and collect the 
watery Sea God's Tear. If the water is still high you need to rescue Tavi &
Riki as explained earlier in the Shrine of the Sea God. This is the event
which drains the water from the shrine's interior.


--Shrine of the Sea God (second run)--
 Go back to the room where you caught Breath. Use "Frost" on the puddles to 
the left to create a passageway. Follow it and you will reach a field that 
is outdoors. Take the leftmost route and jump over the gaps until you reach 
brown pillar; let it fall into the water and step onto it. Jump over to the 
right and enter the next room.
 
 Climb down the wall into the water, and ascend again to the south of here. 
Run over to the right and let yourself fall down the broken bridge. Walk 
around here to reach a Rusty Staff (after Sunshine from Yallam forges this 
you'll get the Glower Staff in return). Use "Lash" to reach the elevated 
section again, run around and fall down the other broken bridge. This way 
Felix can reach the following area. 

 Continue on and hop over the stones in the water, use "Reveal" near the 
hexagon of rocks to make a 7th stone in the center appear. On the island 
there a similar statue as in Daila's Temple is seen, hence use the 'Sea 
God's Tear' to make the water level rise. Climb three more ladders in order 
to claim the Right Prong! Use "Retreat" for a quick exit.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
9B.1. Evaporating water in Aqua Rock
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Apojii Islands--
Inn:
 56 Coins
Hidden Items: 5 (135)
 182 Coins    - Check brown jar to the far south of town's entrance
 32 Coins     - Hidden in a wooden barrel inside the upper right hut
 Mint         - Use "Cyclone" on a bush in the lower right corner of town
 Herb         - Use "Cyclone" on the group of bushes below the Aqua Stone
 Bramble Seed - Use "Cyclone" on the bushes 1 screen to the right of town
Djinni:
 Jupiter Djinni - Haze (reachable after getting "Sand")

 People around here speak about Aqua Rock and Gaia Falls. This is sure a 
watery environment near the edge of the world. The merchant around here 
sells the Dragon Axe, which is a strong weapon that may serve you pretty 
well. Use "Douse" on the big blue tear shaped rock in the center of the 
village. This will cause the Moai statues to move out of the way at the 
entrance of Aqua Rock on the island to the south. You should go there right 
now.

 One screen to the right of Apojii village you can find a Jupiter Djinni in 
the lower right corner near the edge of the world, but a visit to Gaia Rock 
is needed before we can get to him. If you already got "Sand" from Gaia 
Rock then use it here, while standing on the beach. Then go to the right 
under past the rocks. On the screen to the right fall down the cascade and 
you can enter a cave.


--Apojii Islands Cave--
Monsters:
 Faery, Man o' War, Roc

 Inside use "Whirlwind" on the third patch of overgrowth foliage on the 
wall to reveal a hidden passage. Follow it and you will get to Jupiter 
Djinni Haze, whom joins for free (for a change).


--Aqua Rock (Exterior)--
Chests: 4 (139)
 Nut, Elixir, Oil Drop, Mist Sabre
Monsters:
 Faery, Man o' War, Roc, Virago

Walk around this place and climb up the first wall, run up diagonally 
against the current towards the left and keep on following the leftmost 
route. Do this, until you reach a movable pillar and two red Moai statues. 
"Move" the pillar in front of the left statue, but don't push it past it or 
you will fall down (the push animation takes too long to get this done). So 
climb down a bit and take the right branch. Pull the statue towards you 
with "Move", when you stand little more than one square away from it. This 
allows you to place the pillar in front of the right Moai. Climb down again 
or let the current take you there (much faster) and use the right path to 
reach a dead end on the next screen.

 You can't cross the big pool by jumping around the tiles here, but you can 
climb down the rightmost wall and then try to run as far to the right as 
possible. You will fall down, but that is okay. After falling down keep on 
heading diagonally up-right and you can reach a chest with a Nut inside. 
From here go down right again and use "Douse" on the dried up Moai statue 
so it will create a new water stream. Step on this stream and you will 
reach a lower level near the entrance of Aqua rock, where you will find 
another Water stone. "Douse" it and you will notice that the stream changes 
direction upwards! 

 Walk to the climbable wall to the left. If you would like another Elixir, 
who doesn't... (<-sarcasm), take the left branch first. Fall / Climb down 
and carefully maneuver past the water stream on the right. Climb atop 
another wall and push the pillar on your right so you don't have to do that 
part again. After creating this shortcut you can ascend the wall by using 
the reversed water stream.

 On the next screen push the little blue rocks into the water and use the 
lower passage to get over the current. Once you are on the other side you 
can use the up most spot of the stream to reach an Oil Drop. Anyway go up 
against the wall. Follow the left path, use "Frost" on the three water 
puddles (don't forget the two in the back if you want a Mist Sabre as 
well). Continue on to the right and use "Douse" on the tear-shaped rock on 
the next screen. This will open the path to the inside of Aqua Rock.


--Aqua Rock (Interior)--
Chests: 7 (146)
 Vial, Crystal Powder, Tear Stone, Water of Life, Lucky Pepper,
 Aquarius Rock, Rusty Sword (forges Robber's Blade)
Djinn:
  Mercury Djinni - Steam
Enemies:
 Mimic, Faery, Ghost Mage, Lizard Fighter, Man o' War, Roc, Sea Dragon,
 Virago

 This is a very confusing dungeon so stay close to the description, unless 
you wish to wander around this place for a long time. Of course you can 
listen to the BGM if you like it that much. From the start go one screen 
down and follow the right wall, jumping over the yellow tiles in order to 
reach the passage. Go up through another doorway and you will reach a room 
with two columns, two vents and a chest. To get the chest and past the 
vents do the following things:

 1. Push the left pillar in front of the vent
 2. Walk past it and pull the pillar with "Move" towards you
 3. Use "Move" on the right pillar so it moves in front of the second vent
 4. Walk around this one as well and "Move" it away from the vent
 5. Collect the Vial

Follow the path down, on the next screen, "Move" the pillar in front of the 
Moai so the water level drops, freeze 3 puddles and jump around towards the 
lower right exit. At the branch take the lower path first and Felix will 
end up at the lone chest with some Crystal Powder (all these treasures are 
so lame). At the branch again, head up until you reach another Water Stone.

 "Douse" this Water Stone to create a new path. Follow it and stick to the 
left wall here. You will reach two more ventilation shafts, so use the 
pillar to obstruct the RIGHT vent with "Move". Let yourself fall down using 
the left vent, jump over one tile and walk to a puzzle room. You can only 
move upper right pillar so there is only one path to create; just move it 
one square right & down. "Douse" the Moai then Aqua Stone in this order and 
keep on walking through various room (there is only one path), until you 
reach a room with a big waterfall.

 Inside keep on running diagonally up against the current on the upper 
level, this will cause you to fall down on the 2nd tile. By doing this you 
should be able to get across the other side. Once you get down, you need to 
walk a little into the water, fall down and "Move" the pillar away from 
you. This helps you to reach a chest with a Tear stone. The next room has 
various exits, but all of them except the leftmost one are dead ends for 
the time being. So go to the leftmost passage way and activate the Moai 
statue inside so you can reach the next puzzle a few chambers ahead.

 For this puzzle room you can use either two set-ups:
  1. Push the small blue rock on the center of the three tiles and
     "Frost" on the water puddle.
  2. Push the small blue rock on the left-most tile
 Then use "Douse" on the statue to reach:
  1. Chest with Water of Life
  2. The next chamber 

 Jump over the yellow tiles in the big chamber and use "Move" on the pillar 
so you can push it into the gap (this also creates a shortcut). Continue 
on, push another pillar into its gap and take the stairway to the north of 
the pillar. Follow the path and go over the tightrope, jump over the 
rightmost path of yellow tiles to reach another puzzle room. Look at the 
picture below and just simple move pillars 1, 2 and 3 into the correct 
position. Activate the Moai statue and the Aqua rock (marked by A)

After doing this go down the stairs a push another pillar out of the way, 
jump over to the other side and jump around the tiles in the next part of 
this dungeon. The too-easy-to-reach chest in the upper right corner is 
actually a Mimic!

Mimic 4

 Item: Potion

 After beating him (or not) go to the left exit and there will be a huge 
Psynergy rock in the center of this cave like room. Touch it to replenish 
all PP and exit via the lower path. Outside "Douse" the big rock to reach a 
Lucky Pepper and an Aquarius Rock (you are very close of finishing this 
dungeon). On the right half of this place, take the exit to the far south, 
walk around following the left wall as much as possible and Felix should 
end up at the empty column. Place the Aquarius Stone then some magic will 
occur and you can finally reach the new Psynergy called "Parch" that is 
written on the tablet hidden deeply in this temple. Use it right away so 
you can exit this room.

 Of course you could use "Retreat" to get on with your quest, but there are 
still some things to be done around here. So I'll handle those here. For 
one thing you can use it on the water near the sunken chest with a Rusty 
Sword (Robber's Blade) inside in the southern most room. Take the exit here
to get outside Aqua Rock.

 Go back to the location where you found the Aquarius Stone, this time 
follow the lower rightmost exit. Reach out for the other side of the 
watery current and use "Parch" on the statue to stop the stream. Again, 
as expected Djinni "Steam" wants to fight before joining.

 After this just use "Retreat" twice to save you some hassle of walking 
back the entire road for nothing. To continue our search for the Trident 
part seek out for Tundaria.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
9B.2. The Frozen Tower of Tundaria (Center Prong)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Tundaria Continent (World Map)--
 On open sea go to the far south of the world and head for point 18 on the 
map (see Ch. 7). It is a very long walk so it will take some time to get 
there. Before entering the Tundaria tower go a bit farther to the south
west, until you reach a dead end inlet. Here is the location where you can 
find a Jupiter Djinni called Wheeze.

--Tundaria Tower--
Hidden Items: 2 (148)
 Burst Brooch, Center Prong
Chests: 8 (156)
 365 Coins, Mint, Crystal Powder, Hard Nut, Lucky Medal, Sylph Feather,
 Lightning Sword, Vial
Djinn:
 Mars Djinni - Reflux
Monsters:
 Dinox, Harridan, Living Armor, Magicore*, Minotaurus^, Needle Egg,
 Stone Soldier

   * = Drops Aura Gloves
   ^ = Drops Tartarus Axe
 
 Enter the tower and "Parch" both left and right bodies of water. Take 
the right door and follow the path, until you reach a branch with two 
exits. From here on follow the upper branch and collect 365 Coins from the 
chest, then walk on the black ice. Continue on until you reach another 
black ice field. In order to solve this puzzle go from the entrance to the 
field:

     RURULDR - URUR   -> Chest (Mint)
             - UL     -> Center Exit
             - DRURDR -> Right Exit (Back to start; don't take it)

                          (L = Left, R = Right, D = Down, U = Up)

As denoted in the part above do not take the right exit, but use the 
passage in the center of the field. Go upstairs and you will find three 
exits here. There is more than one route to choose, so I'll start with the 
door on the left. Go on and use "Pound" on the icy column, do it again on 
the leftmost pillar in the next chamber for a chest with Crystal Powder, 
use the other two to reach another for a Hard Nut. 

 Go back and take the lower path, fall down the black ice slide and you 
reach yet another sliding puzzle. This time a Mars Djinni called Reflux is 
your reward. From the start follow this route.

    LURU RDLU RDRU LDRU R -> Djinni  
    (L = Left, R= Right, D = Down, U = Up)

 Coins: 563
 Item: -

 After collecting him you should have 5 Djinn of each type, except Mercury
of which there should be 6 in your inventory. Go to the initial room and
head through the remaining right exit. Slide over the ice towards another
simple puzzle. Follow these steps:

  -"Pound" both right and center ice columns
  -"Move" the right pillar: Down, Left, Up
  -Go up the right ladder and pull the pillar towards you with "Move"
  -"Move" the left pillar: Left, Up, Right
  -Climb up the left ladder and push the other pillar out of the way

 In the backroom go up one level until you reach a dead end in the shape of 
an icy wall. Cast Sheba's "Reveal" on it to open up your path. Outside 
climb up the ladder to your lower right, "Move" the pillar out of your way 
and collect the Burst Brooch. This will bestow the "Burst" Psynergy on the 
person you equip it to. After this climb down three ladders and use "Burst" 
right away on the brown part of the exterior wall. This provides a 
shortcut.

 Next backtrack to the first room (or use "Retreat"), follow the center 
path and you'll reach an ice crystal with something stuck inside. Use 
"Burst" on it and you'll obtain the center prong from the broken icy 
spike.

 Before exiting Tundaria Tower go down the left path in the first room, 
follow the path and use "Burst" on the icy wall at the dead end. This 
allows you to get: a Lucky Medal, Sylph Feather (forgeable ore for 
Sunshine), Lightning Sword and a Vial from the chests grouped by two in 
each room.

 Now is a good time to visit Yallam to forge some weapons and sell all the 
junk you retrieved. The inventory is too small in this game, thanks to all
the junk Psynergy items... Do you remember the ship in Alhafra? There was 
a big rock blocking the mast. How about using "Burst" on it! See the 
Chapter 10.2 a few pages down about this matter, if you really want to
complete that part. Other than that we can seek out for the remaining 
Trident part(s).
  


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
9C.2. Sacrifice to the Serpent in Mt. Mikage 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 You can come here right away, but it may actually be a better idea to get 
the "Center Prong" first because the monsters in that quest are somewhat 
easier. First we go to Izumo and Gaia Rock located on the big island in the 
northern east hemisphere.


--Izumo--
Inn:
 60 Coins
Hidden Items: 7 (163)
 Festival Coat - In a wooden box inside the home to the south east of town
 Antidote(2)   - Use "Cyclone" on bushes in the lower right corner
 Lucky Medal   - Use "Cyclone" on bushes on the elevated section (NW part)
 Elixir        - Check the right jar outside the most northern home
 Water of Life - Jar far north; jump across river behind the left home
 Smoke Bomb    - White jar inside the most eastern home
Djinn:
 Mars - Coal

 The people of Izumo speak of a sacrifice that is being held. A young woman 
will be chosen to be sacrificed to the Serpent of Gaia Rock (known as Mt. 
Mikage to the locals). Apparently this year Kushinada is the woman that 
will be sacrificed. If you try to talk to her in her cabin in the northwest 
corner she sends you out without seeing you for she thinks that you are 
Susa. Susa is the man who will meet his demise when he tries to rescue her 
from the Serpent or so she thinks. Take note that you can buy weapons like 
the Shamshir and Ninja Blade here.


--Gaia Rock (Exterior)--
Hidden Items: 1 (164)
 Dancing Idol
Chests: 2 (166)
 Nut, Apple
Monsters:
 Clay Gargoyle, Fire Worm, Golem, Gnome Mage, Wight

 Before going inside the rock we first need to complete some events 
outside. At least you can challenge the serpent right now, but the battle 
is nearly impossible to win. First go up the left wall and push the pillar 
down the edge. Climb up and down so you can "Move" the pillar into the 
center tile, so this creates a path over the gap. Use it and climb up 
towards the next screen. 

 Climb up the right wall until you cannot get up any further, then go down 
in the center to reach a chest with a Nut. Get up again, fall down the 
slide on your left and climb up again via the leftmost route. To your left 
you see an Air's Rock like statue blowing wind against a vine causing it to 
move. With this in mind climb down, until you see a vine hanging over a 
gap, cast "Whirlwind" on it and Felix can swing to the other side in Tarzan 
style. "Move" the brown pillar to the left and head back to the right, 
climb down and follow the only path around here.

 Two screens further you will encounter some more wind statues. Be careful 
in the next part, because statue faces will pop up from the wall causing 
you to fall down all the way. The easiest way to avoid them is by starting 
at the right and following the right path as much as possible. At the part 
you can choose between three distinct paths follow the center of the center 
path for the shortest safe route to the top. At the top follow the northern 
path through the mini-maze (you also have to jump over a pillar here) to 
find a chest with an Apple inside.

 Go back a bit and "Move" the pillar to the lowest position. Follow the 
path and use "Reveal" on the altar to make a dancing idol appear. Examine 
the odd little guy and you get it as an item (although it color is brown 
now). Backtrack/"Retreat" to the start and go inside Gaia rock.


--Gaia Rock (Interior)--
Hidden Items: 1 (167)
 Cloud Brand - Use "Sand" to get behind the serpent on the right side,
               then examine the rightmost tile
Chests: 1 (168)
 Rusty Mace (forges Demon Mace)
Monsters:
 Mad Plant, Mimic, Clay Gargoyle, Dread Hound*, Fire Worm, Gnome Mage,
 Golem, Mad Vermin, Wood Walker
Boss: 
 Serpent
 
  * = Can drop Prophet's Hat

 Use the Idol on the first altar inside the rock. There are three paths to 
choose from Left, Center & Right. Take the right, inside follow the left 
path as much as possible and use "Cyclone" in the center of the spot filled 
with bushes. This creates some green moving platforms, but you can't reach 
them from this side so go back and take the left route.

 Back in the first room go left. Go on to where you reach the platform room 
again. Follow the lower path of platforms and you'll reach a huge room with 
several exits. Firstly, follow the left exit and use "Cyclone" on the 
bushes for a fight with a Mad Plant.

 Special:  Poisonous Bite, Maneater
 Exp:     630
 Coins:   451
 Item: Potion

 Continue on down, but before traveling over the wall step down and use the 
Idol on the altar in the back room to activate the first light beam (which 
weakens the Serpent). Go back and climb over to the right, keep low at the
first junction, and follow the topmost route from the second part to the
end. In the next room use "Cyclone" on the spider cobweb. This will cause
the altar to fall down one floor, go down the slide behind it and use
"Cyclone" on the bushes here to activate the 2nd light beam. Use the Idol
two more times and all four should be active right now.

 The center path leads to a small puzzle with two rocks. To solve this one 
use "Move" in upward direction on the first rock, do it again, and "Move" 
it to the right. Next pull the other rock with "Move" towards you until you 
can place it in the left inlet. Continue on and you will reach a maze with 
a small plant in the center of each screen. Equip a Mars Djinni on Felix or 
a Venus Djinni to Jenna in order to be able to use "Growth" (assign it to 
L or R button to make the next part easier). Use it on the plant so it will 
point out the direction for you. Note that in the third room you find a...

Mimic 5

 HP:  707    ATK: 240    AGL: 145      Weak:    Fire
 PP:   64    DEF:  66    LCK:  17      Strong:  Wind
 Special: Debilitate, Psy Drain, Sleep, Curse, Sonic Slash
 Exp:    840
 Coins:  531
 Item: Game Ticket

 Keep on going and you'll find a Rusty Mace (Demon Mace) in a chest along 
the 7th screen. Do this 12 times and you'll reach the mighty Serpent's 
lair. You'll see a small cut scene where Susa is trying to beat the reptile 
in order to save Kushinada. You can take on the Serpent if you like, but 
its strength differs depending on the amount of crystals you have 
activated. If all four are out then the Serpent heals about 2500 HP per 
battle and has 3 turns each round; which makes it nearly impossible to 
beat, unless you are cheating of course. If on the other hand you activated 
all 4, then it heals only 30 HP and has only 2 turns per round. BTW. Don't 
forget to set your Djinn back to their original status.

     2 Lights | 3 |  270 |
     3 Lights | 3 |   90 |
     4 Lights | 2 |   30 |

 Even with all four beams active this monster still has a huge amount of 
HP, so this battle will take some time. Make sure you have at least one 
character capable of using Wish/Aura Psynergy, because most of the 
Serpent's attacks are multi target. So all four adepts may need to be 
healed most of the time; you can also use your Mist Potion for this as 
well.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 After his defeat the Serpent is squalling in pain, but it not even close 
to dying. Susa appears again and delivers the fatal blow to grant the 
creature his rest and also saving Kushinada. He kindly thanks you and 
leaves you behind. Before you leave check out the stone tablet that appears 
from the ground. It is a new Venus Psynergy for Felix.

 This is the power of "Sand" which allows you to traverse through the sand. 
Use it right away to get past the petrified serpent. Examine the rightmost 
watery tile near the end of his tail to find the Cloud Brand! Now that you 
have learned this Psynergy you can complete the animal trade quest plus you 
can finally tackle the Ankohl ruins with success.


--Izumo--
 Back in Izumo talk to Kushinada at Uzume's place and after some dialogue 
you get to hear about the Cloud Brand Susa found at Mt. Mikage (Gaia Rock) 
and this quest has ended successfully (you could have collected it right 
away if you read the text above). After the conversation give the Dancing 
Idol to Uzume and she'll give you Coal the Mars Djinni in return. Before 
leaving town, go to the most northern part and "Move" the leftmost pillar 
to the right, use "Reveal" allowing you to enter the cave.


--Izumo Ruins--
Chests: 1 (169)
 Phantasmal Mail
Stone Tablet:
 Ulysses
Monsters:
 Fire Worm, Golem, Gressil*, Wight, Wood Walker

    * = drops Otafuku Mask

 Inside use your newly acquired "Sand" Psynergy on the sandy area in the 
center to get to the other side. This way you can use "Frost" on both 
puddles without having to stomp the center columns. Jump over to the other 
side, in the next room go to the right, down the ladder, "Pound" the 
pillar, use "Sand" to reach past the obstacle and "Move" to get the brown 
pillar at the end in the center.

 Go back to the beginning of the room and follow the left path so you can 
reach the ladder leading down one floor. Climb up the ladder to the right 
and collect the Phantasmal Mail (Luck +7). Then get back down and "Pound" 
either pillar. "Parch" the pool on the left so you can reach the back room. 
In here you can find the stone tablet, which contains the Ulysses Summon. 
This deity can stun your opponents meaning that they must skip a turn 
sometimes.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
8C.2. Ascend the Ankohl Ruins in sand (Left Prong)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 After getting "Sand" by completing the events in Izumo and Gaia Rock you 
can get the Left Prong from the ancient ruins of the Ankohl.

--Ankohl Ruins--
Hidden Items: 1 (170)
 Left Prong
Chests: 10 (180)
 210 Coins, Crystal Powder, Nut, Thanatos Mace, Power Bread, 365 Coins,
 Vial, Muni Robe, Sylph Feather, Potion
Monsters:
 Dinox, Harridan, Living Armor, Minotaurus*, Squirrelfang, Wood Walker

   * = drops Tartarus Axe

 Inside you can find 3 empty chests on either left and right alcoves (so 
you could skip these anyway). There are many fake overgrowth bushes in here 
so to spare yourself PP and time only use it on the bushes/overgrowth that 
are mentioned. Head up and use "Whirlwind" on the center bush, and follow 
the path straight up. From here you can go into three different directions. 
But before continuing on use "Move" on all the statue faces and to create
several new paths for to explore. Start on the right and collect some 
Crystal Powder in the room behind the rightmost stone face. Go back and 
enter the entrance directly to the left of it, "Whirlwind" the overgrowth
and use "Move" on the column in the back room. The second left entrance
contains a chest with 210 Coins. Lastly, enter the passage behind left 
most statue and use "Sand" to reach a hidden chest with a Nut.

 Back in the central room go down the bottom left passage. Walk to the 
left and keep close to the lowest path. Go to up the stairs and use 
"Sand" in the next room on the sandy part to reach a chest (it contains 
the Thanatos Mace). Follow the path up into the back room, push the left
part of the stone face into its position and watch how the area fills up
with sand. Go back to the first room just before reaching the central
chamber and use "Whirlwind" on the upper left bush. This reveals a hidden
stairway.

 Climb down the vines, collect the Power Bread in the back room and use 
"Sand" to get behind the wall. Upstairs follow the path to the southeast, 
go into the back room, "Move" the pillar in the upper left corner to the 
left. Go back to the previous room, get to the upper left passage and use 
"Sand" in the room behind to get past the pillar you just moved. This will 
give you a Vial from the red chest as a reward. Go back and if you like to 
collect 365 coins (I'm having a déjà vu here) from the chest to the 
south of here.

 Back in the corridor where you pushed the pillar to the left continue on 
to the far right. In the next room trigger the switch, wait a moment and 
the area fills up with enough sand so you can also trigger the right 
switch. Do so and the path to the next corridor is opened. Inside that room 
you'll have to jump over all the gaps and go down the slide. Push the brown 
pillar and the part of the stone face into the correct positions. Exit via 
the upper passage, "Move" the pillar out of the way on the right side of 
the screen, go back where you came from and use the lower passage (climb 
down one vine), follow this path and use "Sand" along the way.

 Hey, you're back in the central room. Guess what, the right passage is the 
only place left to go. Inside that room use "Sand" to get to the staircase 
in the center, upstairs use "Whirlwind" on the left overgrowth to find a 
Muni Robe in the room behind it. Continue on, climb down and up some vines 
on the left side of the screen and head through the doorway, use "Sand" to 
get past all the square blocks. Provided that you moved the pillar as 
explained earlier. 

 Use "Whirlwind" to remove the left overgrowth here; behind it is a Sylph 
Feather. Go down the right door and repeat the switch triggering scene as 
before. Don't forget to run, because the sand fills up much quicker! In 
the next room remove the right overgrowth, go inside the entrance, push the 
pillar, climb down the vines and jump over the gap to get the chest's 
Potion for free. Get back and exit via the leftmost doorway.

 Push the right half of the statue in its place and the eyes start to glow 
greenish. Go back all the way, until you can reach that face statue from 
the left, climb down the vines and stand before it. The statue will now try 
to push you out of the corridor. So quickly go to the sandy area and use 
"Sand" to hide underground. Once it is past you, get on the surface and use 
"Sand" on the sand patch near the upper wall. In the rooms that follow 
directions are easy. Use "Move" on the pillar so you have a shortcut.

 Next you will reach a room with brown and red stones and a part of a stone 
face statue. Use "Reveal" to make a gap appear and then push the statue 
into it. Go downstairs push the face into position, then exit it and enter 
the room again from the other side (use the shortcut). Use "Sand" to get to 
the leftmost stairway, follow the route and finally collect the Left Prong 
outside on top of Ankohl Ruins! You should have gotten all three parts in 
your collection as of this moment. What remains is forging them into one 
again. This can be done in Champa by the old ma'am Obaba.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. Going to Lemuria
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Even after you collect all three parts of the trident you still need to 
forge it and find your way through the Sea of Time. This chapter deals will 
all the small subtasks you need to complete in order to enter the kingdom 
of Lemuria.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.1. Clear the Alhafran Boat
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Champa--
Inn:
 71 Coins
Hidden Items: 7 (187)
 Smoke Bomb  - Wooden box first box when you walk over tightrope 
 12 Coins    - Wooden box outside the sanctum
 Elixir      - Box in the inn
 Sleep Bomb  - Barrel most right room inside the cliff
 Lucky Medal - Jar outside the cliff on the highest level
 Golden Ring - Get from Feizhi (Linked Game only)
 Trident     - Forged by Obaba with the three Prongs
Chests: 1 (188)
 Viking Helm - use "Reveal" on the 6 gravestones to the east
Boss: 
 Avimander

 Walk around here and if you are playing a linked game and you saved Hsu 
from Alpine Crossing in GS1 Feizhi will appear asking you where to find 
Isaac. After a short conversation Felix gets the item that was meant for 
him: the Golden Ring. Take note however that she calls Hsu Ulmuch in this 
game for some strange reason. The translators probably screwed up here.

 Inside the cliff you can meet Obaba; Brigg's grandmother. If you visit her 
at this moment she won't come out, until her grandson Briggs returns. So 
you'll have to give Briggs 'permission' to leave his cell. Unfortunately it 
doesn't work out that simple, but go to Alhafra anyway. When you try to 
leave town Alex pops up. After some chitchat Karst and her fellow Mars 
Adept Agatio appear. After some 'encouraging' words to get the remaining 
two beacons lit they leave town. And if Alex's words are true the old lord 
Babi has met his demise as well. In order to get Obaba to fix your trident 
you will need to reunite her with her grandson Briggs; so back to Alhafra.


--Alhafra--
In order to get Briggs to escape we need to fix the Alhafran Boat, hence 
Felix and the others need to work on clearing the ship's mast. Here's the 
list of things to be done:

 1. Jump over to the right (just below the wooden log) and push
    the 'x' marked block into the water.
 2. Roll the wooden log into the water.
 3. Walk over the mast to the lower right corner and push another
    'x' block into the water.
 4. Use "Move" on the crate to create a path in the water.
 5. From the boat climb down the rope and jump over the debris to the
    right, after reaching the main land again. Use "Move" on the
    crate while standing to the left as far as possible, then pull
    the crate towards you.
 6. Walk up the mast and walk over to the rope towards the rear of
    the ship. Use "Lash" on the rope and poles to reach the other side.
 7. "Pound" the grey cone pillar to free the rope.
 8. "Move" the wooden crate another space to the left and finally push
     it into the water. 
 9. Use "Burst" on the big block in the water. Oh, wait a moment we
    don't have that, until you reach Tundaria Tower. Anyway if you use
    a different Psynergy Jenna will tell you that you have to leave it like
    this, because there is nothing to do about it. If you do use "Burst"
    the mast will be ready for repairs.

If you fixed it completely and try to leave the boat two men will 
compliment you about fixing it. Eoleo and Chaucha will also be pleased to 
see that you managed to fix it... You will be invited for a visit at the 
mayor's place. After a very lengthy conversation (in which you don't have 
to press any buttons, fortunately) a guard comes in and tells you that 
Briggs and his companions escaped.

 The mayor expects you to find Briggs and capture him. So, the only thing 
you can do is checking out the boat docked at the bay, which is indeed gone 
by now. Briggs no longer fears Felix for he thinks that he can never reach 
Champa, because he doesn't have a boat. Briggs also 'thanks' you in his 
polite manner. Better chase him back all the way to Champa for a surprise 
visit!



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.2. Forge the Trident of the Ankohl
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Champa--
 Be prepared for a big fight and also you'll fight Poseidon very soon so 
you might as well get as many items and Djinn as possible. You should have 
6 Djinn of each type at this moment, so don't forget about Haze and Meld.

 If you walk up to the cavern you will see Briggs again at the entrance. He 
runs inside towards the highest level of the caverns. Follow him and you'll 
meet him together with Obaba. She doesn't like somebody beating her 
grandchild up so she sends a monster out of the forging well. This battle 
is quite tough so Obaba actually grants you one chance to leave this place, 
and you better might if you are not well equipped. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Avimander
---------------
 HP: 3792     ATK: 281     AGL: 94       Weak:    Water
 PP:   87     DEF:  89     LCK: 41       Strong:  Fire
 Special: 'attack 2x', Fiery Blast, Fire Breath, Guard, Heat Stun,
          Impair, Star Mine 
 Exp:    2176
 Coins:  1330
 Item: Potion

This boss' weakness is water. So you'd better stick to have Piers attack 
and have Jenna do the healing. If Jenna has more than four Mars Djinn she 
can use the Aura Psynergy series, so she can heal the entire party. The 
Avimander may attack twice and his Fire Breath attack is the most powerful 
attack of the lot. So keep using (preferably water) attacks and eventually 
he will go down.

 Your best summon in this battle is Moloch so put two Mercury and one 
Jupiter on Stand-by at the start of the battle to call him right away. It 
may even induce the "Sleep" status on Avimander plus it raises Mercury 
Power for the caster. So if you summon Moloch twice with Piers the second 
time round it will do much more damage. If you have all Djinn and 
reasonable levels the Avimander should go down without too much trouble, 
but if you take him on before getting any of the Trident parts he may be 
hard.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 After the battle (if you are victorious of course) Obaba will be surprised 
that you defeated her little salamander. She says to Briggs that he has to 
take care of himself now, but Briggs keeps on insisting on how evil Felix 
is supposed to be. Finally Kraden and the other members appear and tell 
Obaba the truth about Briggs. About him being a pirate and stealing the 
Alhafran ship. Chaucha also steps in to protect Briggs and tells everybody 
that Briggs just lend the necessary items to save Champa from starvation 
(that explains the food, but why the jewels anyway...). After some more 
discussion Briggs and his wife leave. Obaba tells you that if you ever need 
any help you can always consult her for information.

 If you show Obaba a piece of the trident she will reveal to you that it is 
a 1/3 of the legendary trident of Ankohl. She even offers to take care of 
the parts you already gathered, saving some slots in your inventory. If you 
give her all three parts the forging process commences. Obaba will throw 
all the pieces into the well, watch the animation and you'll get the 
Trident in return (use "Reveal"). This weapon is actually an item that can 
be used in battle; so it doesn't have any attack power. This item doesn't 
break in battle and can be used on any enemy for some damage. The Trident 
increases water resistance by 20 so I guess Piers or Jenna will have the 
best use for it (equip it permanently).



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.3. A route through the Sea of Time
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


--Sea of Time (Optional)--
 No matter how good you are eventually you will get caught by the currents 
and you will be sent back to the entrance of this sea. You party members 
will talk about how to reach it. Even the Lemurian Piers doesn't know how 
to get back into Lemuria. Question remains how to find the path through 
this sea. The answer lies in Yallam so go there right now.


--Yallam--
 There are two reasons to go to Yallam:
 1. The blacksmith Sunshine can create wonderful items for you.
 2. The children that live here can teach you a song that will help
    you in your quest.

 First go to Sunshine and give him the Rusty weapons you have in your 
inventory. Give him an item and leave for the world map. Immediately return 
to Sunshine and his work is completed, it is as easy as that. I marked to 
locations of Rusty weapons on the world map so get those. Also forgeable 
items like the Tear Stone/Sylph Feather/Star Dust can be forged into 
something neat. Next are the young children on the east side of town. Talk 
to them and they will teach you the following three songs written by Yepp:

Song 1:
----------------------------------
 If you want to go to the stars,
 if you want to go to the stars.

 Go north past the twins,
 passing two swirls, run
 deasil twice 'round the trunk

 Haste without waste, and head to
 the east, past three to the north.

 Then, run 'round thrice and wait
 for the waves. When they stop
 run north and go to the stars.

 If you race full of folly and
 take the wrong way, you'll
 find yourself a watery grave.

Song 2:
----------------------------------
 If you want to go to the moon,
 if you want to go to the moon.

 Face west from the stars and
 run straight past three swirls,
 then circle 'round twice.

 Haste without waste, and head to
 the south, then one swirl west.

 There, run 'round thrice and wait
 for the waves. When they stop,
 run south and go for the moon.

 If you race full of folly and
 take the wrong way, you'll
 find yourself a watery grave.

Song 3:
----------------------------------
 If you want to go to the sun,
 if you want to go to the sun.

 Face south from the moon
 and run straight through two
 swirls, then circle 'round twice.

 Haste without waste, and head to
 the west, then six to the north.

 There, run 'round thrice and wait
 for the waves. When they stop,
 run north and go for the sun.

 If you race full of folly and
 take the wrong way, you'll
 find yourself a watery grave.
---------------------------------

Basically, what this means is a description of how to get through the 
currents in the Sea of Time. Going round the trunk, simply means that you 
have to go in circles around those little volcanoes that you will see along 
the way. If you are doing it correctly stars will appear around the 
volcano. The numbers mean the amount of vortexes that you have to pass in 
each direction, for the rest it should be strait forward.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.4. Defeat Poseidon the Indestructible
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Sea of Time--
Boss: 
 Poseidon

 If you have the complete Trident, then you can undergo an attempt to beat 
Poseidon who guards the path to Lemuria. Follow the path as given by the 
children from Yallam. It is easy to understand, but sometimes the currents 
makes this a very tricky endeavor to complete successfully. If you get 
stuck in a swirl and can't seem to get out use the current of the swirl to 
get a little boost. For example if you need to get out of a swirl towards 
the west, then try to press Up & Left at the same time just before you 
reach west so you will start pushing the Lemurian ship outwards as much as 
possible, I noticed that helped somewhat.

 After you reached the 'sun' the final field appears here there are only 
few currents so you have some room to navigate through. Make sure you have 
the Trident equipped and all your characters are battle ready (i.e. set you 
Djinn or put them on standby). Poseidon is a water creature so expect water 
attacks and use fire power to hit him good. Anyway, go to the left then up 
and meet this so-called indestructible monster.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Poseidon
---------------
 HP: 4905      ATK: 302     AGL: 185       Weak:    Fire
 PP:  162      DEF: 100     LCK:  47       Strong:  Water
 Special: 'Attack 2x','Force Field Protection', Counter Rush, Deluge,
          Ice Missle, Ocean Fist, Ply Well, Typhoon Blow, Watery Grave
 Exp:   2930
 Coins: 3762 
 Item:  Psy Crystal

At the start of the battle have the character that has the Trident use it 
immediately to shatter Poseidon's force field! Only after that item is used 
will he be vulnerable. Also using the trident damages Poseidon quite good 
(for a regular attack). Beware of his counter-rush as well, because he will 
counter all attacks that follow. Make sure you have somebody ready to use 
healing items/Psynergy so you HP doesn't get too low. Summons like Ulysses 
(approx. 1500 Damage) can do great amounts of damage causing Poseidon to 
fall relatively quickly.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 After you finally defeat this merman the path to Lemuria is opened. Go 
north and you'll be on the world map again, but this time you can clearly 
see Lemuria to the north. Don't let your expectations run too high, for 
Lemuria is nice, but as you will notice not the great city it once was.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. Lemuria at last!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Lemuria--
 Dock you boat to the north were lots of Lemurian ships are docked. You 
regain control of Felix and are allowed to search through the ship as well.
By the way you can also collect the Mist Potion from the ship's chest by 
using "Parch" on the raised water level! 

 After getting on the main land you'll notice all the ruins and debris 
along the path. If you use "Move" on the blue Mercury Lighthouse like 
statue two Lemurian guards will notice you. They tell you that you that by 
beating the leviathan Poseidon you are too dangerous to enter town. As 
decreed by their ruler King Hydros. Fortunately our own Lemurian Piers 
steps up and handles with these silly guards.

--Lemuria (main city)--
Inn:
 -
Hidden Items: 5 (193)
 Lucky Medal  - "Scoop" patch with butterfly right of the lucky spring
 Bone         - "Scoop" patch with butterfly near the dog (junk item)
 Star Dust    - "Scoop" patch with butterfly to the left of the palace
 Rusty Sword* - "Scoop" patch with butterfly near the rightmost home
 Hard Nut     - "Growth" on plant to the right, "Cyclone" on the patch
                 of bushes to the south

 * = forges in Corsair's Edge

 If you walk up then Kraden will appear to look around Lemuria and sees the 
palace as a good spot. If you talk to the people you find out that they 
have no motivation to do anything at all. The reason for this is that they 
are near immortal people who age so slow, each and every day seems to be 
the same. You cannot yet enter the palace so Piers suggests looking around 
somewhat more.

 To the left of the lucky spring you can enter a home. Inside a Lemurian 
asks where you come from. It appears to be Piers' uncle and he has some bad 
news for Piers. It turns out that his mother passed away and Piers runs off 
having to cope with this on his own. If you leave you get to hear why Piers 
was send out by King Hydros in the first place. He went outside the Sea of 
Time for the sole purpose of finding Felix & the others and to return them 
to King Hydros! The uncle writes a letter to Lunpa so you can check him out 
in the mean time, while Piers is off.

 After he sends the bird go to the far right, try to open the main door and 
you will see Lunpa on the highest balcony. He tells you the door is broken 
so use "Lash" to enter a home from the middle balcony. Enter the home and 
you can meet him inside, by going down either left or right stairs (they 
look like darkened wall next to the ladder). For the people that played 
GS1, indeed Lunpa is the father Donpa of Lunpa village. After some talking 
Lunpa exits his place via the door and settles an audience with the king. 
You are now allowed inside the palace (oddly, Piers has vanished from the 
graveyard as well).

--Hydros' Castle--
Hidden Items: 1 (194)
 Lucky Medal  - In a barrel inside the palace barracks on the right side
Chests: 1 (195)
 Grind Stone 

 Inside you can walk around freely and go upstairs towards the King's room. 
Piers, Lunpa, Conservato and King Hydros are all here. A conversation 
starts, which will take some time, but there is some useful information in 
it about the game's plot. You get the Grindstone in order to destroy the 
rocks that block your path to the outside world and now you can also 
destroy the rock at the Gondowan Cliffs allowing you to reach the western 
hemisphere!

 When you leave you get to hear a conversation about Piers' age, but he 
won't tell under any circumstances. Before leaving Lemuria go back and use 
"Grind" on the brown rock to reach another part of Lemuria.

 Spring of Lemuria
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Up in center of town is a spring. Talk to the guy in front and he'll tell 
you about throwing coins into the center for lucky prizes. This thing is 
exactly the same as in Tolbi from Golden Sun 1 (so people how have played 
it know how it works). Talk to the guy in front of it and you are allowed 
to go near the fountain itself. The goal of this game is pretty simple: 
Turn your back to the fountain and throw a coin or a Lucky Medal in it, and 
see where it lands. Throwing in coins is rather useless since you hardly 
get anything back for it:

Coins
---------------------------
Center Circle: 20 Coins
1st Circle:    10 Coins
2nd Circle:     2 Coins
3rd Circle:     1 Coins
Outer Circle:   0 Coins

------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|

 This is a list of the prizes that I found in the corresponding circles. 
Also note that Eclipse only turns up once, automatically rewarded the first
time when you score in the center bull's eye ring. He requires 3 Jupiter & 
2 Mercury Djinn on Stand-by. His secondary effect is lowering target's ATK.


--Ancient Lemuria--
Djinn: Mercury - Rime
 The only thing we can do here is using "Cyclone" on the leftmost bush (you 
can just reach it with the Psynergy). This trigger a Mercury Djinni to 
appear, which will hide in the blue statue (obviously) and after using 
"Tremor" it joins you after a fi... wait a sec, it you joins you straight 
away!



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. Djinn hunting on the Western Hemisphere
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Gondowan Cliffs--
 Use "Grind" on the rock here and you are done! Continue to the south and 
you have reached the western part of Weyard.


--Western Sea--
Hidden Items: 3 (198)
 Rusty Sword - Examine light spot (see location on map below)
 Rusty Sword - Examine light spot (see location on map below)
 Rusty Staff - Examine light spot (see location on map below)
 
 Fortunately, the west is much simpler even though it is bigger in size. 
The western part is actually much smaller in the sense that there are only 
a few interesting places:

       ______^^^^^^^^^^ M ^^^^^^\

First of all get the two items from the water marked by 1 and 3 (2 is not 
reachable yet) for some new weapons. 


--SW Atteka Islet--
Chests: 1 (199)
 Dragon Skin
Djinn:
 Jupiter - "missing GS1 Djinni"

 Push the pillar into the water, next push the crate into the water at the 
higher level. Because of the waterfall it will slide down and get stuck 
behind the pillar. This creates a path to a chest with Dragon Skin. After 
Isaac joins your team you can use "Lift" on the boulder here to find a 
missing GS1 Jupiter Djinni, if you got less than 7 Jupiter Djinn from the 
GS1 Squadron.


--Kalt Island--
Hidden Items: 1 (200)
 Apple - Left of the screen in the tree; use "Catch" on it
Djinn:
 Mercury - Gel

 The 2 people on this island give you hints about the northern parts of the 
sea. They speak about a village named Prox to the north, this village is 
isolated from the rest of the world, because the river is completely 
frozen. However if you happen to have a so-called Magma Ball then you may 
be able to pass it. Take note that the Apple outside can only be collected 
with "Catch". This is a Psynergy you will obtain when Isaac joins you after 
the Jupiter Lighthouse. Anyway, to get the Mercury Djinni to join you do 
the following things. From the frozen river entrance go into the following 
directions (they are abbreviated) LDRULURULURULDL, then use "Lash" on the 
rope, next get Gel the watery Mercury Djinni.
 

--Gondowan Settlement--
Hidden Items: 1 (201)
 Lucky Medal - Check the center left gravestone
Chests: 1 (202)
 Star Dust

 There is not much to do around here some people talk about Magma Rock 
being dangerous and stuff like that (what else is new). Use "Cyclone" on 
the leftmost bush to reveal a staircase. Down under is a chest with Star 
Dust.


--Hesperia Settlement--
Chests: 1 (203)
 166 Coins
Djinn:
 Mars - Tinder

At the entrance climb the left vine, use "Growth" on the plant to the left, 
"Move" the crate towards you and then push it down via the leftmost gap. 
Next push it down, use "Move" on it towards the right, and finally climb 
over the wall to collect Mars Djinni Tinder. You can also collect 166 Coins 
from the chest in the back room inside the wall around here.


--Hesperia North (World Map)--
Djinn: 
 Venus - Petra

From the north-east beach navigate your ship into the river and keep 
following the left route. Eventually you'll reach a dead end, get out of 
your ship on the left side and Felix will find Petra wandering about around 
here!

--Atteka (World Map)--
Djinn:
 Mars - Core

 Go to the continent of Atteka. There is only one thing you can do here 
right now and that is getting a Mars Djinni. On the world map go to the 
most western beach of the lower big continent, dock your boat here and walk 
to the rightmost place you can get here. Around one of the clearings in the 
forest you should meet a Mars Djinni that goes by the name of: Core.

--Atteka Inlet--
Chests: 2 (205)
 Vial, Orihalcon* (Linked Game only)
Djinn:
 Venus - Geode*

 * = reachable after Isaac joins you

 From the left screen climb up the ladder, walk over to the right to the 
right screen, get down the vine and collect the Vial from the chest near 
this place. After Isaac joins in you can get a Venus Djinn around here. Use 
"Lift" on the sphere boulder and then "Cyclone" on the bush behind it to 
make it appear. This Djinni called Geode will come along without a hassle. 

To the north of the Atteka Inlet you'll find a large crater next to a 
small town. This is Contigo home to the ancient Jupiter tribe.

--Contigo--
Inn:
 80 Coins
Hidden Items: 3 (208)
 Corn         - Examine the lower part of the corn table
 Bramble Seed - Use "Cyclone" on the upper left bush in town
 Power Bread  - Inside the barrel near the sanctum on the east side
Djinn:
 Venus - Salt
 Mars  - Shine (Need "Force" - Linked Game only)

 From the entrance of town walk to the right and you'll see a huge patch of 
bushes, with the center patch being open. "Scoop" here and you find Venus 
Djinni Salt. You can also find the Slot Machine and the Lucky Dice games 
from GS1, plus an additional new dice game.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 Lucky Wheels - Slot Machine
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 To the left of the Inn is a tent that leads to the Lucky Wheels gambling 
game. This is actually one of the more interesting ways to spend your time, 
at least try to get some shirts and boots for these are very handy. The 
shirts can be worn underneath your regular armor, so be sure to equip them 
anyway even if they may appear to be a bit weak. Also the Hyper Boots have 
the ability to increase the chance your weapon does an Unleash (if the 
weapon has one in the first place), these unleashes are quite important 
since those attacks are very strong.

 You can either spend 1, 2, 3 or 4 tickets at once. It would be a waste to 
spend 4 tickets in one turn, since you can easily get an item if you play a 
little strategically (I can say this out of own experience that 2 tickets 
is more than enough usually). Walk up to the slot machine and press A to 
start playing. After the first turn select the group you want that has the 
most aligned items already. For example if you want to win either any Ring,  
Shirt or Boot then look at which row has the most of either of these items 
(e.g. has the greatest chance). Lock those Slots including the Slots on 
which the row has a Moon (Moon is a "Joker" that counts for anything) and 
pull the lever again and hope for some good results, then go for that type 
for the next 4 rounds. 9 out of 10 times I can get the desired prize this 
way.

 Note that it is even possible to get more than one item using this method. 
I once managed to win some boots and a shirt with another row. In theory 
this would mean that you can earn up to 7 prizes, but I it is impossible to 
pull this off in practice without hacking the game. I think you can 
consider yourself very lucky if you get three items in one go.

  Boots         Shirts          Rings          Star/Heart     Moon (Joker)
  ------------- --------------- -------------- -------------- -------------
   Fur Boots     Mythril Shirt   Adept's Ring   Vial           Anything
   Quick Boots   Running Shirt   Sleep Ring     Water of Life
   Hyper Boots   Silk Shirt      War Ring       Potion

 Additionally, each time you reset the GBA the first item you win cannot
be either Hyper Boots or Mythril Shirt. Also game does not reward you with
the same prize in a row. Thus after getting the first boots / shirt you
have 50-50 chance of getting Hyper boots / Mythril shirt for the next time
if you get the a win in the category boots or shirts respectively. Lastly,
because the RNG is highly time dependent (in frames) it's impossible to 
generate a decent RN strategy to fool the game. To get infinite amount of 
game tickets see the Extra appendix for a trick.

 Lucky Dice
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 Inside the small tent (Marked with a Dice on the front) you can play the 
Lucky Dice Mini-Game. The idea here is that you either match up the same 
dice or you throw the dice in such a way they land on the same area on the 
table. This is called a pair. 

   Single Match:    1x your bet (No loss / Profit)
   Double Match:    2x your bet
   Triple Match:    3x your bet
   Quadruple Match: 5x your bet

This game doesn't give you any prizes other than coins and the winning you 
make with it are not very useful, so you might as well spend your time on 
other things.

 Super Lucky Dice
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 Somewhat similar to the Lucky Dice game this game features four dice. You 
throw all four on the table a see if you have any matches if you get 
anything better than a 'Two of a kind' you get to play the Hi-Lo Game. Here 
you must guess whether the next throw will have a higher or lower value 
than the current one. Each time you guess correctly the amount of coins 
doubles, after 5 successful guesses automatically get paid.

   Two of a Kind:   1x your bet (No loss / profit)
   Three of a Kind: 2x your bet
   Two pairs:       3x your bet
   Four of a Kind:  8x your bet
 
   Hi-Lo Game:      2x your bet each correct guess

   Highest win: Four of Kind & 5 correct guesses Hi-Lo game
                    8x * 2x^5 = 128x your bet

As with the Lucky Dice this game doesn't allow you to win any prizes other 
than coins.

After going through all of these various location, mapped all places. You
should have collect 8 Venus, 8 Mars, 6 Jupiter & 8 Mercury Djinn by now.
The lack of Jupiter Djinn will soon be compensated, so don't worry about 
missing any of them.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. The Road of Trials that lie ahead
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

After you get the Djinn, Forgeable items (and a visit to Sunshine) read on 
to continue with the quest. So we continue on with the actual adventure; go 
to the most upper left beach part Hesperia. Walk to the east from here, 
until you reach a cave.


--Shaman Village Cave--
Hidden Items: 1 (209)
 Golden Shirt* (Linked Game only)
Djinn:
 Mercury - Eddy*
Monsters:
 Pteranodon, Slayer, Talon Runner, Wargold, Wild Gryphon, Wolfkin 

   * = reachable after Isaac joins

 Inside the center path leads to a Mercury Djinni that can only be reached 
after obtaining "Lift", but we don't have that now, so go to the left. Use 
"Whirlwind" on the overgrowth, follow the path behind it and push the brown 
pillar two spots to the right to create a shortcut. And viola, that was 
all!


--Shaman Village--
Inn:
 80 Coins
Hidden Items: 4 (213)
 Elixir        - The white jar downstairs the inn
 Weasel's claw - Right barrel downstairs in Moapa's house
 Lucky Pepper  - Right jar in Shaman's hut (after Trial Road)
 Lucky Medal   - Jar on balcony of rightmost home (after Trial Road)
Chests: 1 (214)
 Spirit Gloves
Djinn:
 Jupiter - Aroma

 Nobody seems to talk to you. "Mind read" some people and you'll find out 
that there are strict order from the village shaman to keep outsider out. 
The cleric inside the cave is the only person who will talk. For some 
Spirit Gloves: Check out the inn, go downstairs here, outside again, head 
to the north, use "Growth" (Venus / Mars Djinn swap in order to learn it, 
remember) and collect them from the chest.

 Go to the upper left cabin and Moapa comes out. This may seem like a dead 
end. Every time you talk to them the inventory opens up meaning that he 
requires an item, but which one? GS1 player should know that the Shaman's 
rod is also referred to as the rod of Hesperia. Now, which continent are we 
on? Indeed, show him this rod and finally it will become clear what the 
purpose of this thing is, that has been stuck in your inventory for so 
long.

 After you display the rod Moapa comes towards you, he speaks about 
guarding the Hover Jade, which bestows "Hover". He is supposed to give it 
to the people who bring the rod, but Moapa doesn't think you are worthy. So 
he puts you to the test. Go to the north of town and meet up with Moapa at 
Trial Road's entrance.


--Trial Road--
Hidden Items: 1 (215)
 Hover Jade - Receive from Moapa after battling him on Trial Road
Chests: 11 (226)
 Hard Nut, Nut, Potion (3x), Vial (6x)
Boss:
 Moapa & Knights (2x)

 Moapa tells you to make the sand disappear as a first test. You see a 
purple rock similar to the ones at Air's Rock so you know what to do! 
Because it is a special occasion Sheba will personally appear and use 
"Whirlwind". After some mockery that a woman can't claim the Hover Jade 
even though Sheba cleared fulfilled the task the real trial begins. Walk up 
to Moapa again and he gives you hints about what is about to happen. This 
event looks somewhat similar to the Colosso event in GS1; so GS1 players 
should be familiar with this.

 There are four stages each having a door at the end. You work your way up 
and at the end you have to place items in the blue chests in order to open 
the door. This means that you will have to drop some equipment you have 
obtained, because light equipment like items won't open the doors (don't 
worry you'll get it back after the event). Note that in this conversation 
Felix says "Why?"!

 Also make sure you reach the top before your adversary does or else you 
will be in a bad position, for you will have to drop twice the weight. So I 
recommend you read the instructions below carefully in order to get to the 
top a.s.a.p., or use the arrow button to reset the trial from the start 
again. You may choose either left or right route, I've noticed that the 
left route is far easier than right so I'd pick that to get at the top of 
each chamber in the fastest manner. Before you start you can pick up a Hard 
Nut from the chest to your left. 

The time spend using Psynergy doesn't count, so using "Move" or "Whirlwind" 
doesn't slow you down at all! Finally note that you get stripped of all the 
non equipped weapons and armor, so you can't cheat your way out of placing 
items into the chests. There are four stages so I guess giving 1 piece of 
armor from each character is the most balanced way of getting to the top. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Trial Road Stage #1 Left--
 For the quickest rout, use "Sand" to get up the stream, enter main land on 
the right side, use "Whirlwind" to reveal a vine, climb up (this is quicker 
than walking the tightrope). Put some type of armor into the chest at the 
top, because you really need the weapons to cause damage to Moapa at the 
end. The chest to the left here contains a potion, if you really want it.


--Trial Road Stage #2 Left--
 Push the horizontal log up, then push the lower vertical log to the left 
(and to the right if you want the Vial). Next:
  -"Move" the pillar up 1 spot
  -Push the horizontal log up
  -Push upper vertical log left
  -Push the horizontal log down
  -Push the pillar into the upper left corner
  -Push the upper log into the water
Now you can climb up to the second door, put an item in (you should be 
ahead of your opponent). 


--Trial Road Stage #3 Left--
 Go up again, use "Whirlwind" on the right bush covered pillar, Push/"Move" 
it up, climb the left vine, jump over the gap, climb the center vine 
(collect the Vial to the left if you please) and put another item in the 
chest (when I did this Moapa was still on the second stage, but he goes 
through stage #3 in breeze so don't slow down!).


--Trial Road Stage #4 Left--
 The quickest rout in my opinion is pushing the pillar in the center spot, 
climbing the vine and using the fountains to reach the final door (you have 
to wait in the middle). Collect the Potion from the chest by going down the 
vine on the right, but that is optional.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Trial Road Stage #1 Right--
 Use "Pound" on both cone shaped rocky pillar and push the left pillar on 
the left pounded pillar, use "Whirlwind" on the center pillar to remove the 
overgrowth and place it on the other pounded pillar. The chest in the 
center contains a Vial.


--Trial Road Stage #2 Right--
If you don't want the Vial, then just push the left pillar to the up most 
position. Climb the vine and leave to the next room.


--Trial Road Stage #3 Right--
 Optionally collect the nut from the chest to the left. Go up the right 
vine, stand on the pillar twice so it crumbles and climb up the right vine 
behind it. The other two chests on the upper level contain a Potion and 
Vial from left to right.


--Trial Road Stage #4 Right--
 You can collect the Vial from the chest by pushing the right torch against 
the icy pillar. This will melt it allowing you to reach that chest behind 
it. Go back Refreeze the puddle after moving the torch to either left or 
right. "Move" the two pillars towards you, melt the left icy rock with the 
aid of the torch and push the torch so it doesn't touch the water puddle 
anymore. Jump over it and cast "Frost" on it again. After this you can 
reach the top.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Trial Road Final Stage--
Go up to the center where the battle takes place. Moapa and his companions 
will appear immediately if you are the first to reach the top, else they 
will be waiting. Time for a Boss Battle:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Moapa & Knights (2x)
------------------
Moapa
 HP: 3042     ATK: 354     AGL: 181       Weak:    All
 PP:    0     DEF:   *     LCK:  40       Strong:  -
 Special: Bosca Hit, uses 'Crystal Powder' / 'Nut' / 'Water of Life'
 Exp:   1670

Knight
 HP:  1954     ATK: 321     AGL: 143       Weak:    All

 Special: Strong Hit, uses 'Bramble Seed' / 'Nut' / 'Elixir'
 Exp:   835
 Coins: 205 
 Item:  -

        Defense Table:

        Win        |Moapa |Knight
        -----------|------|------
        0 Rounds   |  219 |  151
        1 Round    |  219 |  106
        2 Rounds   |  219 |  106
        3 Rounds   |  174 |  106
        4 Rounds   |  120 |  106

This battle is not the hardest, but it will be quite long since all three 
members have a lot of HP. Try to focus your attacks on one enemy, before 
taking on the other two. Moapa's Bosca Hit causes over 150 damage. I 
noticed that these opponents are very vulnerable to the Sleep Status 
induced by "Sleep" Psynergy and the Ulysses Summon, so use these to make 
your life a little easier. As always humans are weak to all elements so all 
attacks and any kind of Summon will work here.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
After the battle Moapa surrenders the Hover Jade as a trade for the 
Shaman's Rod (finally, you get rid of that silly thing). You get warped 
back to the village where you see Felix resting on a bed in the inn.

 Felix can get a Jupiter Djinni now. Go to the rightmost home and ascend 
the stairs inside, go outside and exit to the right screen. "Move" the 
pillar in the gap and go back to Moapa's place, use "Lash" and now you can 
reach Aroma.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
14. Jupiter Lighthouse - Reunion!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to reach the lighthouse go to the south continent and enter via 
the center right river, then go south-west to reach Atteka Inlet, and from
then on head to the far north. The lighthouse awaits!

--Jupiter Lighthouse--
Hidden Items: 4 (230)
 Mint      - Use "Cyclone" on the bushes outside the lighthouse
 Red Key   - Get it with "Hover" after activating the lighthouse
 Blue Key  - Retrieve from the left sub-tower (fall down several layers)
 Mars Star - Get it from Isaac after his battle with Agatio & Karst
Chests: 8 (238)
 Erinyes Tunic, Meditation Rod, Psy Crystal, 306 Coins, Mist Potion, 
 Potion, Water of Life, Phaeton's Blade
Djinn:
 Jupiter - Whorl
Monsters:
 Mad Plant, Mimic, Blue Dragon*, Devil Scorpion, Ghost Army, Macetail,
 Foul Mummy, Wyvern^
Boss:
 Karst & Agatio

  * = Can drop Rising Mace     (weakness Fire)
  ^ = Can drop Aeolian Cassock (weakness Wind)
 
--Jupiter Lighthouse (Entrance)--
 At last we have found the third of the four lighthouses. This dungeon is 
going to be big and long so take your time. Walk around here and you'll 
find a dead end with Cyclone teleporter. Before using it, use "Cyclone" on 
the lower right bushes to obtain Mint leaf. Once you use the teleporter you 
get beneath the surface. In the lower right corner use "Cyclone" to reveal 
a Mad Plant.
-----------
Mad Plant 4
-----------
 HP:  726     ATK: 352     AGL: 152       Weak:    Fire
 PP:    0     DEF:  99     LCK:  20       Strong:  Water
 Special:  Poisonous Bite, Maneater
 Exp:  1065
 Coins: 594
 Item: Mint

 Continue on via the rightmost path and use "Hover" which you obtained from 
Moapa in Hesperia on the purple energy tile to float to the right. Using 
"Cyclone" on the teleporter behind it gets you get back into the 
lighthouse. Push the pillar onto the button so the main gates are opened.


--Jupiter Lighthouse--
 Go up into a big central room. There is not much to do here for the moment 
so follow the left path, until you reach a log moving puzzle. Actually,
they are all fallen pillars, but it is essentially the same. I'll call 
the upper log 1, and the other three logs are 2, 3 and 4 from left to 
right.

   1 -> up
   2 -> up
   3 -> left
   4 -> up
   3 -> right
   Collect Erinyes Tunic from the chest

Go down the doorway and use "Cyclone" to get one level up. Enter the 
building again, follow the lower left route, go outside to find another 
entrance, go up stairs, walk to the back in that room and use "Reveal" in 
order to reach jumping puzzle room.

 Jump over the gaps to the right path, go a bit down and jump back to the 
center. Here you can use the slide for a one-way ride to the lower level. 
"Move" the upper pillar to the far left, push the lower right pillar left 1 
square and the leftmost pillar up as far as possible. Climb up on the left 
side of the screen and you should be able to reach the chest with the 
Meditation Rod inside.

 Go outside and push the grey block one square to the right, next stand on 
the button to make the block fall down a few layers. By doing this you have 
created a shortcut. Go back inside, and up the stairway in the upper left 
corner. Follow the only path, until you reach the lighthouse aerie. Take 
note that you still have to remove the lit from the gap in order to throw 
the Jupiter Star in. So go inside the lighthouse at the left entrance 
(opposite to where you came from). 

 Inside again, go down the stairs, fall down the slide and walk up to the 
center of the room. Then you hear a voice saying that you should show the 
power of the Anemos, which means that a Jupiter Psynergy is required. Get 
up the ladder and use "Hover" on the elevated platform to trigger all the 
hover platforms in the building. Now that the lighthouse is activated, we 
can do a lot more.

 Go through the rightmost passage, use "Hover" on the purple tile to get 
the Red Key. Push the center block onto the purple tile in order to be able 
to jump over the gap to the left. Retrace your steps, until you reach the 
room with the hidden platform (you used "Reveal" here). Instead of going 
back via the left path, go right (use "Reveal" again) for a Psy Crystal. 
Now you can go back all the way to where you found a Cyclone teleporter 
that we skipped earlier.

 Go up one level by use "Cyclone" on it, use the Red Key on the Red Door, 
continue past it and you will be outside again. Watch out for the 
whirlwinds that are exhaled by the stone face on the left. Use the gaps as 
safe places, when one is close to you.


--Jupiter Lighthouse (Left Tower)--
 Inside you can see a statue of an archer pointing east, just a clue of 
what is about to come. Naturally the easy to reach chest on the left side 
of the screen in the back room is a decoy.

After this very short battle go up via the right passage, until you reach 
some blue logs. However, you should come to the conclusion that it is never 
possible to the reach the blue key. You have to fall down here from a 
higher level in order to reach it. For now push the lower right log down 
and go up the stairs once again.

 Exactly as expected, there is dark blue cracked floor tile in the center 
which should lead to the blue key, but again you cannot reach this crack so 
you'll have to drop down from another floor up. Take note that you can step 
only 1 time on the tiles with little cracks. The easiest way to collect 
both chests is by following right route first and collecting the 306 Coins 
from the right chest. After you do this you have to fall down one room, so 
get up and after reaching this room again go through the lower passage.

 Now step back into the previous room (the crack will be complete again), 
"Move" the column on your left to the left so it falls down the gap. Walk 
counter clockwise around the room following the route close to the wall and 
you can collect a Mist Potion. Fall down again and continue your way to the 
top of this mini tower (note that on the highest levels stronger creatures 
like the Blue Dragon start to appear).

 Eventually you will reach a room filled with cracked floor tiles. To solve 
this puzzle complete the following steps:

 1. Walk over to the left hover tile
 2. Use "Hover" on it and get to the far left pillar
 3. "Move" it onto the button
 4. Walk to the upper right corner
 5. Use "Hover" on and walk past the array of darkened tiles in mid air.
 6. Get to the lower right passage and go upstairs.

 Once you are outside the building and you'll see a big version of the 
stone archer statue. Push the energy path block into the gap and the Archer 
will shoot an arrow towards the left angel. This will energize it in such a 
way that it starts to lift the left half of the lid. Now we have to do this 
for the right angel as well and we are done!

 Go inside again, fall down the crack, then head upstairs in the room 
below, and get to the lone cracked tile so you can collect the Blue Key. 
After obtaining it make your way back to the main tower of the lighthouse.


--Jupiter Lighthouse--
 Go down again using the Cyclone teleporter. Walk up to the pillar in the 
back of the room, use "Move" on it (this is part of a short cut for later 
on). Backtrack somewhat more, until you reach a room with 5 grey blocks of 
which 4 are hovering. "Move" the rightmost block in its place so you have a 
little bridge to the right side of the room. Follow the route and you'll be 
back in the central room of the tower on a high ledge. Push the energy path 
block down the ledge, fall down and push it into the gap. Felix can now 
"Hover" to the left ledge.

 Use "Cyclone" to reach the upper right stairway around here. In the back 
of the room another pillar can be found. Use "Move" on it and you have now 
created a shortcut allowing you to reach both left and right part of the 
tower with relative ease. Anyway, follow the lower right branch to get 
outside again. Push the weird block it the gap and observe as Felix watches 
around him how the upper right hover square gets activated. 

 Retrace your steps to the central room again and use "Hover" on the ledge 
you currently are. In mid air walk to the left and you'll step on the beam 
in the center. Once this happens you get transported to a higher level. 
Walk to the right, climb down the stairs and "Move" the grey block one 
right. This way you can obtain a Potion from the chest. After getting this 
item or not, follow the passageway so you will reach the blue door. Note 
that whatever you do; DO NOT use "Cyclone" on the teleporter here or else 
you have to walk around the entire way back. Use the Blue Key on the door, 
then use "Hover" outside and Felix reaches the right tower.


--Jupiter Lighthouse (Right Tower)--
 Similar to the left tower you'll find an archer statue at the entrance. 
Walk up the center path and you find a big room with a Jupiter Djinni on 
the left side. First use "Hover" on the only purple tile around, then push 
the energy path tile down, follow using the slide, push it into the 
rightmost gap and use the newly created purple tile to reach the left 
ledge. Push the other block down with "Move" then slide down as well, push 
it into the gap and the cone shaped pillar appears to the right.

 If you have some time to get the Djinni "Pound" the pillar so the blocks 
emerge from their gaps and place the corner tile in the leftmost gap and 
the strait line in the right gap. At last you can reach out for the Djinni 
Whorl.

 After combat Whorl decides to get smart and tag along with your group. You 
actually do NOT need to reset both blocks because from this second set up 
you can reach the upper right passage as well. Simply use "Hover" on the 
lower right tile and Felix can reach behind the upper ledge just behind the 
three blocks. Upstairs "Pound" the pillar, push the block in the center of 
the three gap squares, jump over to the right and climb down the stairs. 
Here is the lay-out for this puzzle. There are two paths one for the chest 
(containing Water of Life) in the lower right corner and one for the exit 
in the lower left corner.

      Setup 1: chest             Setup 2: exit
      --------------             -------------
             |                          |
             v                          v 
       O-OOB-BO                   O-BOB-BO
       ¦  ¦  ¦¦                   ¦  ¦  ¦¦
       ¦ O-BB-¦                   ¦ B-OO-¦
       ¦ ¦    ¦                   ¦ ¦    ¦
       O-O--B-B                   B-B--O-O

 When you are done with the setup get back up to the entrance of the room, 
"Move" the block back into the energy path and now you can jump over the 
gaps using those blocks. After you reached the exit push the pillar onto 
the button thus creating yet another shortcut. Go upstairs and walk to the 
right over the cracked floor tile. Carefully avoid the dark tiles and watch 
out for the whirlwinds coming from the two faces on the wall. Get to the 
lower right corner, the passage should be just south from here.

 This room has a ton of hover tiles on the ground allowing you to be under 
the influence of "Hover" constantly. You can go up via either left or 
right passageway. Again dodge the whirlwinds from the mouths of the statues.
The left passage contains a chest with Phaeton's Blade. Equip this on 
Felix for he needs a strong weapon at the lighthouse aerie later on. Follow
the right branch and get to the passage behind the hover tiles. This 
part may be extremely hard to traverse, but it can be done. You have to 
pass the second statue from the right path over the cracked tiles, run in 
mid-air and you can just barely make is past in one go. Outside do the same 
thing in mirror as with the left side and lid is removed from the 
lighthouse.

--Jupiter Lighthouse--
 You know your way around by now. Backtrack to the lighthouse aerie, but 
wait the moment you get close you come across the other party! First you 
see Garet and Mia in distress, then Isaac and Ivan appear (Note how Isaac 
is no longer mute in this game). Kraden and the others appear as well and 
they are watching how Garet is hanging from the ledge of the lighthouse. 
Next you hear Agatio and if he is here then Karst is close by as well! 
After a short introduction they start to fight. It turns out that Mia and 
Garet were part of a trap placed by the two of the Mars clan and so Isaac 
and Ivan have to fight two on two. Note that Alex who was also expected by 
Karst doesn't appear at all.

 So get your party over to them in order to help Isaac and his companions 
out of their troubles. Just before you reach them Alex appears just in 
front of you. He asks whether you are going to light the beacon or not, 
regardless of your answer he will tell you to save them and being a Mercury 
Adept he fully heals your party for the upcoming battle. Outside you see 
how Ivan collapses and how Isaac gets a huge amount of damage in-battle. 
After this cut scene the badly damaged duo leaves for the lighthouse aerie, 
because they still want Felix to ignite it. Felix obliges to this request 
and Piers joins along, while the others take care of Mia and Garet. He also 
collects the Mars star from Isaac and puts it in the Mythril bag along side 
the Jupiter Star.

 Walk up back inside and Alex will be gone. At the top of the lighthouse 
you'll meet up with Karst and Agatio. This will be one big battle two on 
two so be prepared. Throw the Jupiter Star in the big hole and of we go! 
The beacon is lit and Karst steals the final elemental star from you, 
because the Mars Lighthouse is located near Prox; the village they come 
from. In other words you are no longer needed by them. They do tell you 
that Felix's parents are released after this lighthouse is lit, but with 
nobody to guide them home they are stuck there for their remaining years.

 Item:  Dark Matter

The battle commences and you have only Felix and Piers at your disposal. 
Take note that Jenna and Sheba will join you in 2 and 4 rounds 
respectively. Piers' Diamond Berg attack is strong and does mayor damage to 
any of the two Mars Adepts. Take note that Karst's Djinnfest causes 1 Djinn 
of each character to be put in recovery mode! Using the Eclipse / Boreas 
Summon may prove to be valuable. At least have one party member that is 
capable of using Wish/Aura Series, because you need to heal quite often in 
this battle. Preferably use Jenna for this as her Mars Djinn cause less 
damage on both foes (Jenna needs at least four Mars Djinn in order to use 
the Psynergy from the Aura Series).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you finally beat the two Mars adepts Alex shows up and heals them as 
well. You cannot deliver the fatal blow to them, or else Felix's parents 
will die. The three bad guys leave just as the rest of the group appears. 
They leave for Contigo and await your arrival there. You'll automatically 
go down the elevator back to the entrance of the lighthouse. Exit and go 
back to Contigo.


--Contigo--
 Go inside the upper left home (to the north of the inn) to meet up with 
the rest again. The entire story of the disastrous day on Mt. Aleph all 
those years ago is brought up again. Everybody thought that Felix parents 
and Isaac's father got killed, but that did not happen. Nobody died that 
day! They were all saved and captured by Saturos just like Felix himself.

 Not much later Hamma (people from GS1 know her) appears. She is the 
Jupiter adept that passed the ability of "Reveal" down to Ivan. She turns 
out to be a descendant of the Anemos. Ivan is so too and indeed, Ivan and 
Hamma are brother and sister as well. All 8 of you (excluding Kraden) have 
to visit the Mars Lighthouse, because Agatio cannot light the beacon on his 
own for there seems to be a powerful force blocking him. Before leaving 
Hamma tells you to meet her at the inlet to the south where you boat is 
docked. After some chitchat Felix and his companions join your group. You 
have now 2 adepts of each type and 8 members in total. In battle you can 
only use 4 of them at the same time. If you didn't link the game only the 
following things are inherited:

Characters:
 All four are on level 28

  Isaac            Garet            Ivan              Mia

 4 Mars Djinn    - Forge, Scorch, Ember & Torch
 5 Jupiter Djinn - Gust, Breeze, Zephyr, Squall & Luff

Additional Battle Options:

 'Auto-exchange' - If your active party is defeated your back-up party
                   will automatically kick in for them.
 Switch          - Allows you to interchange one character from the
                   active party with the back-up party.
 
 Catch Beads, Lifting Jewel and Carry Stone always get transferred even if 
you don't link the game. This is given, because you need those Psynergies to 
complete the game. If they wouldn't be transferred you get stuck in the 
dungeons later on. The following three items: Cloak Ball, Orb of Force and 
Halt Gem are optional. We don't need Frost Jewel, Douse Drop, Halt Gem and 
Cloak Ball in this game, but the Orb of Force and its Psynergy open up new 
areas. If you got it then use "Force" right away on the tree stump behind 
the inn to find a Mars Djinni: Shine who is glad to join you. The Halt Gem
can be used to get a Venus Djinni in the Yampi Desert cave easier.


--Atteka Islet--
 Don't forget to get Djinni Geode with "Lift" and go to your ship to meet 
Hamma again. As you can see some wings are attached to the ship so you can 
now fly around the world of Weyard! If you saved master Hammet in GS1 and 
Linked that game file a messenger arrives a places a chest in front of you. 
The gift from Master Hammet turns out to be a piece of Orihalcon. With this 
forgeable item you are able to forge the legendary and powerful Excalibur 
(if you are lucky). 

 And above all there are no random battles in the air. The only downside is 
that it consuming much Psynergy. On the world map use "B" button the make 
the ship fly over the obstacles. After you get past everybody cheers, but 
Sheba feels empty. It turns out that she thought the Jupiter Lighthouse 
would help her find out where she came from. As the people of Lalivero only 
know her as she 'fell from the sky'. After the conversation, collect the 
Rusty Sword from the ring to the west marked with '2' on the map in Ch. 11 
(you could not collect this item before).


--Shaman Village Cave--
 If you are playing a linked game and you won the Colosso event the three 
defeated gladiators appear inside the cavern for a rematch!

 I can hardly call this a boss batlle, just like that battle against the 
Bandit and friends. The three Gladiators are still pretty weak and can be 
taken out without any trouble if you ask me. Nuff' said.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
After their defeat you get the Golden Shirt as a prize for letting them 
off. The three of them disappear never to be seen again.

 Use "Lift" on the rightmost boulder in the back room and then again on the 
boulder that can be reached behind this path. Go back to the entrance, 
"Lift" the leftmost boulder, freeze the water puddle and remove the foliage 
to reveal some stairs. Climb them and go to the Mercury Djinni in the 
center. He can't escape anymore, because the boulder is lifted! So meet 
Eddy in combat.

 If you go back again to the top of Trial Road after Isaac and co. join you 
can safely collect all the chests without time limit. You can use "Hover" 
on the purple energy tile to the left. Use it to get to the left cavern. 
"Lift" the rock inside, to reach a small fountain outdoors. "Cyclone" the 
left bushes and a Mad Plant pops up.

Stone Tablet:
 Haurus

 To get here go north from Loho and you'll see a big cave on the map. Enter 
it and traverse several levels down, use "Carry" on the small grey block to 
make it move up 1 position and leave it in the center. Use "Carry" also on 
the upper grey block so it fall down on the right. "Carry" the right block 
1 space to the left and claim your Summon named: Haurus. He costs 3 Venus 
and 2 Mars to summon.


--Atteka Cavern--
Stone Tablet:
 Coatlicue

 In order to get here use the Lemurian Ship after it gets its wings to 
navigate through the air towards this cave. Start from the eastern beach of 
Atteka and work your way down. Avoid the trees, because the ship even in 
flight cannot navigate through there. At the very south is the cave. Inside 
use "Parch" on the water from the right side and use the ladder to reach 
the tablet. The inscriptions tell you how to call Coatlicue. Have 3 Mercury 
and 3 Jupiter Djinn on standby.


--SW Atteka Islet--
 I already mentioned much earlier, but if you got less than 7 Jupiter Djinn 
from the GS1 team you can find an additional Djinni here. Just use "Lift" 
on the sphere boulder and walk around in the area behind it to find him.


--Yallam--
 Use "Force" on the tree stump near Sunshine's home to open the passage to 
a new area. Cast "Cyclone" in the center of the bushes to reveal a passage 
to a chest with the Masamune (also known as the dummied out Kunasagi in 
GS1).



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
15. Cannon ammunition from Magma Rock required 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our goal is to reach Prox and the Mars Lighthouse to the north of the 
northern seas. However if you travel there right now you'll find a huge 
solid ice wall blocking your way, hence we need some heavy artillery to 
blast our way through. Coincidently the people of Loho have a cannon, but 
they need it themselves to blast a wall down. They seem to be stuck as 
well, because they don't have any ammunition. If you manage to find some 
suitable ammunition to load the cannon, then the diggers of Loho will give 
you the cannon in return. Question is where to find some ammo... Perhaps 
taking a look at the nearby mountain range called Magma Rock will shed some 
light on the situation.


--Magma Rock (Exterior)--
Chests: 3 (242)
 Oil Drop, Salamander Tail, 383 Coins
Monsters:
 Mimic, Lich, Little Death, Phoenix, Raging Rock, Wise Gryphon
 
At the start use "Lift" to get entrance to Magma Rock. 


--Magma Rock (Interior)--
Hidden Items: 1 (243)
 Magma Ball - Retrieve it after learning "Blaze"
Chests: 4 (247)
 Lucky Medal, Mist Potion, Salamander Tail, Golem Core

 Go inside right away and challenge the Mimic, but that is all that can be 
done around here for now.

--Magma Rock (Exterior)--
 Climb up the wall near the entrance and use "Burst" on the left statue in 
order to destroy the cracked column. Climb up where the column was and push 
the pillar out of your way, go up the wall again and fall down the left 
slide. Use "Burst" on the statue around here as well, climb up the wall 
just to its right, stand tall on the statue itself and wait, until it fires 
you upward. Jump over to the left and follow the path against the wall. 
Push another pillar to the right and climb up to the next screen. 

 On the right side of this screen you can climb down and collect the Oil 
drop down there. Go up again and follow the rightmost path, use "Growth" on 
the right plant (don't forget to use "Burst" on the statue here) and once 
you are up the wall slide down at the left. "Burst" is the Psynergy to use 
on the Moai statue up here. Go down back to the start of this screen and 
cast "Growth" on the plant around here. Climb up and again use "Burst" on 
the statue to get a free ride up. From here push the pillar to the far left 
and now there are two paths to go (although the upper is a dead end for 
now).

 The left path has 4 different slides. Go down the second from the right to 
find a chest with 383 Coins. Get back up the upper ledge, go down the 
second from the left and use "Lash" on the rope. Activate the statue with 
"Burst" slide down the left slide and quickly get up its head before the 
Moai ignites. Climb all the way over to another pillar and move it so that 
you have another shortcut. Go up one screen using the left branch of the 
right climbable wall section. Walk and jump around to the leftmost pillar, 
"Move" it to the right and jump on the cracked pillars so you end up in the 
center path. Cast "Burst" once again on the statue to make another pillar 
disappear. Climb towards that section and head to the right.

 Before continuing on, follow the lower path and go down one screen, to the 
far left you can find a chest with Salamander Tail. Go back where you came 
from and climb the wall, but beware of the magma rocks the statues are 
volleying. Stick to the left route as the right leads to a dead end. On the 
final screen of Magma Rock's exterior use the Moai on the far right of the 
screen. The Psynergy rock amplifies the power of "Burst" and creates a huge 
explosion.


--Magma Rock (Interior)--
 Inside walk around the only possible path and use "Burst" on the statue to 
make the rooms flood with lava (BTW: a missing GS1 Mars Djinni may appear 
here in the most southern part). Go back one room and jump over the lava 
using the moving platform, follow the left wall from here on until you 
reach the lava room again. The left path leads to a Lucky Medal whereas the 
right leads to the switch that removes the lava from the level. Once you 
did that go down the previously with lava filled part and push the pillar 
up, go up one room and down the stairs marked by the blue gem in the wall. 
Climb down the wall here and take the left southern path, go through the 
upper left exit here and push the pillar down three squares. Next, go back 
one room and then down and eventually you'll reach Fury.

After adding Fury to your collection, go back to the central room and 
"Burst" the Moai Statue so the floor fills up with lava. Walk to the lower 
right corner, jump over the gap, walk the tightrope and collect a Mist 
Potion from the chest in the next room. Cross the lava here using the 
pillar which you placed in the correct position. In the next room you get a 
one way single chance to get across the lava, so use it well. After this 
use "Burst" on both cracked pillars.

 Get back in the big room and let the lava disappear through the gap. Climb 
down again and go down the center exit. Now that the pillar is gone you can 
climb up and go through the passage marked by the blue gem. Follow the path 
behind it, use "Burst" to raise the lava level in the room that follows. 
The moving platforms are activated and you can reach the very left side of 
the room. Go down as far as possible and you can let the lava run away 
through the gate by pressing the button. 

 Go back up use "Whirlwind" on the chains, climb down the wall and collect 
a Salamander Tail from the chest in the room behind the entrance. Go up one 
room and push all the pillars to the right. Before raising the lava level 
again, go up one room to where a second gate is located and collect the 
Golem Core from the chest. Also you can go down via the lower right passage 
in the main room and push the pillar to the right for yet another shortcut. 
In the end get back up the higher level using those chains again and this 
time use the left Moai Statue to flood all the rooms with lava in the 
central room.

 After flooding use the moving platforms and the pillars to get to find a 
new path. At the very end push a pillar into the lava, head up via the left 
passage and make the lava flow away by opening the gate once again. Head 
down and through another passage marked by a blue gem. You are back at the 
entrance here! Push the pillar into the lava and go into the next chamber. 
If you jump on the right ledge you will see that some rocks, fireballs and 
a very rare magma rock appear. There is not much to do about this so 
continue on to the next room.

 Inside follow the path and you'll reach a tablet with a new Psynergy. Of 
course this is meant for a fire adept and Garet... hey the game 
automatically prefers Jenna here to get the "Blaze" Psynergy. This allows 
you to manipulate existing fires (you cannot create fire with it). So use 
it right away on the flame to open the passage outside again. Go back to 
the room with the Magma Ball and use "Blaze" on the lower left flame so you 
can ignite the left torch. Use "Blaze" again to open the passageway, follow 
the short road and collect the Magma Ball from the red rock.

 
 --Loho--
Inn: 88 Coins
Hidden Items: 4 (251)
 Crystal Powder - Check Barrel near the most south eastern home
 Mythril Silver - Use "Scoop" under right wall in the lower left corner
 Golem Core     - Use "Scoop" on it behind the wall after using the cannon
 Golem Core     - Cast "Lift" on the rock and then "Scoop" on the ground
Djinn:
 Jupiter - Lull

 Here in Loho there are many diggers trying to find valuables, but none 
have been successful. There is a cannon at the far right end of town, but 
it doesn't have any ammunition to shoot down the wall to the north. If you 
manage to do this you can get the cannon for free! So now that you have 
been through Magma Rock use the Magma Ball on the cannon and BOOM! The 
three guys are also willing to put the cannon on your ship for free, 
because you helped them. Now you can reach Prox behind the northern 
reaches. Note that you can get some Golem Cores and access to Lull the 
Jupiter Djinni. 



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
16. Mars Lighthouse behind the northern reaches
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Northern Reaches--
Monsters:
 Grand Chimera, Phoenix, Spiral Shell, Turtle Dragon

 Navigate through the seas here and you'll find the icy wall that is 
holding you back from reaching Prox and the Mars Lighthouse. Use the cannon 
on it and your passage is clear. After some talking you can go up and reach 
Prox right away. 

--Prox--
Inn:
 200 Coins
Hidden Items: 4 (255)
 Cookie         - Look in the jar just outside the inn on the left
 Potion         - Check the green jar in the inn
 Sacred feather - Wooden box in the basement of the most northern residence
 Dark Matter    - Use "Lift" on the boulder and "Scoop" on the black dot
Djinn:
 Venus   - Mold 
 Mercury - "missing GS1 Djinni"

 The people of Prox know Felix pretty well and the innkeeper also tells him 
that his parents just left. Also note how all the people in Prox look 
frozenly blue, and most of them are living in poverty. Walk up the riverbed 
that is covered with snow and go up one screen. Here you'll bump into a 
Venus Djinn. Touch it and it disappears. Use "Scoop" on the little pile of 
snow to make him appear again, so Mold can join you.

 Head up via the northern exit and visit the mayor to the right. You'll 
overhear a conversation about setting Felix's parents free. Inside the home 
is a Mercury Djinni from GS1 if you didn't get all 7 in the previous game. 
Go up the left branch and you'll meet Puelle the leader of the clan. They 
are pretty surprised to see Felix return after all this time.

The final mandatory dungeon of this game and it is a big one. Right from 
the start walk up to the lighthouse, climb up the ladders and go to the 
place where you would, except the left elevator. Here you will see a chest 
containing an Apple. Use it for a small boost in power. Enter the 
lighthouse, use "Pound" on the rightmost ice cone pillar and examine the 
chest to start a battle against Mimic, who will relinquish a Cookie when 
you beat it.

 Item: Cookie

Walk through the maze of pinnacles to the right entrance, walk around the 
back room and exit it on the left side. Back in the main room go up the 
leftmost entrance, follow the left wall, climb the stairs, "Pound" the ice 
cone in your path and continue on until your reach a dead end. Examine the 
ice here and use "Grind" on it to cause a crack to appear in the big ice 
sheet one floor below. Go back to that place and "Burst" it.

 In the room behind it is a teleportation circle, but you need "Teleport" 
in order to be able to use it. So go through the doorway on the far left. 
In the chamber behind you have to avoid the flames, which is not that 
difficult. Note however that you also have to get the statue on the far 
left all the way to the right to block the last flame thrower. So set 
"Move" to the 'L' or 'R' button and use it to move the statue over there.

 The directions to get past the black ice field towards the left are: 
LURDL. In the room behind use "Blaze" to activate the dragon statue and it 
will cause a crack in the ice for you. Go back and take the lower passage, 
use "Burst" on the cracked ice and another pathway is clear. Inside is a
hidden Teleporter Circle that will only show itself when you "Reveal" it. 
So take the right passage all the same. In the right room use "Blaze" so 
the dragon statue emits a fire ball. This melts all the ice on its way 
clearing the route to the doorway to the south. 

 Here you'll be in a corridor with three entrances. The center only has a 
chest with Orihalcon. Go inside the rightmost one, "Pound" all the ice 
cones from the side and use the newly created gaps to evade the constant 
stream of fireballs. Work your way up towards the next chamber. Again a 
Black Ice room, but before starting to slide use "Move" on the left dragon 
statue (clever trick, programmers!). Slide into the following direction: 
DLDLURULDL then go either Down (for a battle against Mercury Djinni) or Up 
for the exit.

After the battle Balm becomes friends with you. Slide up, go upstairs, fall 
down towards the chest and collect the Teleport Lapis. The final Psynergy 
"Teleport" is now yours to command! Now you can tackle all of the optional 
Dungeons: Yampi Desert, Islet of Time & Anemos Inner Sanctum (See appendix 
C for details). But before you do so, you'd better collect some stronger 
weapons and the most powerful weapon in the game is very near, so get it 
first.

 In any case, equip the Lapis and use "Teleport" on the circle. Go back to 
the room where you removed the ice and the hidden teleporter, which I 
mentioned just a few minutes ago. Use "Teleport" here, go down the stairs, 
but do NOT slide down right away. Go down to the lower level on the right, 
run all the way to the left and collect the Valkyrie Mail from the chest. 
Get back and you may slide down. This will trigger a fire breathing dragon 
face to go all the way to the left. If it gets there the big dragon gets 
activated and a huge fireball will wipe out Felix, which means you have to 
start all over again. So get the following part done in one go.

 Once the head is activated use "Pound" on all the rocks and work your way 
over the black ice using the most northern route. At the end use "Pound" 
two more times on the most upper cones. You should have about 3 to 4 
seconds to spare. Don't go via the teleporter, but walk by the corridor 
behind it. "Move" the statue so it blocks the flames. Now it is safe to 
"Teleport". After this Felix will reach another jumping puzzle.

 Jump from the leftmost tile down 3 times, walk to the right, jump up, down 
4 times, then go to the upper right and collect the almighty Sol Blade 
(this weapon begs for a field test!). The left path leads to the following 
rooms. Walk up and you'll see two yellow dragons frozen in ice, as expected 
when you use "Blaze" and "Burst" they will unfreeze. This causes a boss 
battle! Strange two dragons; with one being a bit smaller than the other...

There attacks seem to be very similar to the ones of another duo... Could 
it be? Indeed they are Karst and Agatio. You beat them one time, so do it 
again. The Sol Blade's unleash Megiddo and Diamond Berg Psynergy will 
surely help you out. Also Summon Azul from Treasure Island's Tablet with 
Piers for over 2000 damage! So actually it is not too hard to beat them up 
a second time round.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the battle is over their true identities are revealed indeed, they are 
however in no condition to complete their current task and gives Felix the 
Mars Star. Pick it up from the floor and put it in the Mythril Bag, walk up 
to the statue behind it and examine it. Just after you got the Mars Star 
you give it away by putting it in the statue's face. The ice disappears and 
the Mars Lighthouse becomes a place of the fire element once more. Pick up 
the star again and leave this room. There is nothing you can do to help the 
two wounded people.

 Go back to the entrance of the lighthouse ("Retreat" saves some time). Use 
"Blaze" on the leftmost flame to melt all the ice and then "Burst" on the 
big sheet of ice. Go inside the rightmost room, follow the right wall, and 
you'll come across a second Djinn in this dungeon. Mars Djinn Fugue puts up 
a fight before joining you however.

 After the battle go back again to the entrance room and go up the center 
stairs. The big dragon statue tells you to complete the four quests for 
each element. You can do these in any order, but I'll present them like 
this.


Wind - Bird... On the wings of truth, they ruled the winds.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Enter the upper and left tower use "Cyclone" on the left teleporter. In the 
next room use it on the left teleporter as well, use "Move" on the statue, 
go back all the way and the use the right teleporter. You'll be back in the 
big room and the fire will be blocked allowing you to pass by.

 Climb down the stairs, use "Reveal" and "Cyclone" on the 6 blocks to get 
to the next room. "Cyclone" back again on the other pad, quickly use "Move" 
to activate the hover tile on the left and let yourself fall down by 
getting hit by the flame. Use "Hover" to get past the flame thrower and 
"Cyclone" to get to the higher level on the center teleporter pad.

 Quickly get out of the way or else you'll get hit by the fire ball. 
Collect the Psy Crystal from the chest on the left. After a fire ball 
passes by use "Reveal" on the stepping stones to find a secret path to the 
right. Follow it, go outside and cast "Blaze" on the purple flame to 
activate the Jupiter Beacon. Just three more flames to go. Let yourself get 
hit by the big fire ball inside for a shortcut back. 


Water - Fish... With cold courage, they ruled the water.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 Go to the entrance of the lower left tower. Ascend the stairs and walk on 
to the black ice field. The directions are: LDRULU. Go inside the doorway 
and here you'll have to fix the pipeline.

 1. Freeze the upper right water puddle
 2. Push the upper horizontal pipe up
 3. Freeze the center puddle
 4. Push the upper horizontal pipe down
 5. Push the vertical pipe right
 6. Push the lower horizontal pipe up

 Next go back and start on the black ice again from the right. Go LDRURU 
use "Blaze" so most of the ice bergs are removed (odd that that ice doesn't 
melt itself). Go over the black ice for a third time following: LDRDL. Head 
outside and ignite the Mercury Beacon.


Fire - Dragons... Burning with might, they ruled the fires.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 Before entering the dragon Tower, collect the Alastor's Hood in the far 
right corner outside. Inside use "Burst" on both cracked wall sections. Go 
up the left passage and in the top left corner press the button to activate 
a torch. Go back to the beginning, take the right path and use "Blaze" on 
the torch to crack the center wall section. Go back, "Burst" it and follow 
that path to reach the stairs on the left. 

 In the pipe maze room push the first pipe into position, then follow the 
path behind it and use "Move" on the statue near the right wall. Next use 
"Move" on it again from above so the flame thrower is blocked. Follow the 
path that is now opened. Push the pipe section out of the line again so the 
flame thrower runs dry. This allows you to reach the bottom exit, outside 
"Blaze" the torch again to light the Mars Beacon. Only one more to go!


Earth - Mankind... With the power of wisdom, they ruled the earth.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 Inside this tower only use "Move" on the rightmost statue, the other two 
are traps. In the next room only the leftmost statue conceals a doorway, 
take it, jump over the gap on the lower level and fill the two gaps on the 
upper ledge with the two "Carry" stones. Push the upper stone to the far 
right so it blocks the flame thrower. Walk down the tightrope, push the 
statue down and go to the left. Use "Sand" to hide from the flame thrower 
if they get close. Go outside again and ignite the final flame of Venus.

 Get back into the central room and the path to the Mars Lighthouse Aerie 
is opened! Let Felix "Teleport" towards the final showdown on top of the 
lighthouse midst the storm (hmm this setting reminds me of the prologue in 
GS1). 



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Final. Dawn of the Golden Sun 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Mars Lighthouse Aerie--
 You get teleported just outside the lighthouse aerie, so jump up the 
floating platforms. Heal all yours characters to the max, set all your 
Djinn and prepare for battle! As expect you will deal with a fire enemy 
that is weak to water. So consider having both Piers and Mia in your first 
party. Or alternatively use some of the other class settings to get strong 
Mercury attacks.

   WARNING: This is the last point where you can save! If you have any

            other than an unplayable "Clear Data" file.
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =


 Walk up to the center of the aerie and somebody calls you "betrayers". All 
8 party members and Kraden appear trying to figure out where the voice came 
from. Just before Felix throws in the Mars Star he gets blocked. The voice 
tells you that Isaac and Garet should know him, but they both shake their 
heads. Kraden recognizes the voice and GS1 player should remember that very 
same character at the very beginning of the game. Indeed, it is the Wise 
One. The Cyclops Rock appears and Isaac explains what happened back that 
day when they met inside Sol Sanctum. 

 He is very unpleased to see that Isaac and all the others disobeyed his 
command in retrieving the elemental stars. Instead all the other 3 
lighthouses were lit. The Wise One reasons that if Alchemy is released 
mankind itself may destroy the world with all the powers that will be 
unleashed along with it. Similar to what the elders of the Lemurian Council 
feared. Come to think of it, what do you think Alex's motives are? He is 
currently climbing Mount Aleph and will be at the right spot where all of 
the light will gather if the last lighthouse is lit. The Wise One tells you 
that when the final light beam hits Sol Sanctum the Golden Sun shall rise, 
which will give him a near infinite amount of power. 

 The rock also tells you that he cannot interfere with human actions and 
therefore cannot stop Alex. Yet he does prevent Felix from throwing the 
final star in the hole. He then tells that even though he can't stop you 
himself a 'miracle' could occur that prevents you from completing the task, 
however... A three headed dragon appears, which seems to be similar to the 
two-headed Fusion Dragon from GS1. How much more difficult could that be to 
defeat. Kraden figures out that the two headed dragon was Saturos and 
Menardi together. So what would the 3-headed dragon be? But before Kraden 
can stop the 8 adepts they go into battle!

This is the final battle that consists of three consecutive rounds. Each 
time you slay the dragon it will lose one head and can use one attack less, 
however the intensity of the attacks does increase with each round. This 
enemy is capable of using Djinn Blast: All Djinn on Recovery for one 
Character. With only 1 head left the dragon gets Djinn Storm, which puts 
all Djinn for all your main characters in recovery! This is a pretty cruel 
attack if you are hoarding Djinn for a Summon Rush, then again I noticed 
that Doom Dragon doesn't use these very often so you can make use of the 
Summons. The normal 'Summon Rush' won't work on him, because you have to 
face all three versions of the Doom Dragon in the same battle 
independently. Moreover, the power of a Summon depends on the maximum amount 
of HP of the target. Thus keep in mind summon rushing this adversary won't
work.

----------------
Regular Strategy
----------------
 What you can do is boost all statistics and then start beating him up 
good. This tactic will work, because the Doom Dragon is one of the few 
bosses that is not capable of using "Break", meaning that you can always 
attack with increased powers. Try to distribute some Elixirs and Mist 
Potions among your members so everybody can heal/cure everybody when 
needed. The Doom Dragon tends to use Status Ailment attacks (e.g. Curse & 
Haunt) more often than the other enemies in this game and this will be a 
long battle so you do have to worry about these matters.

 The Dragon is in all three cases weak to wind so if you are going to 
Summon make sure that it is Catastrophe or Eclipse for maximum damage. 
Don't let the 4 attacks of the Doom Dragon's initial attack set intimidate 
you, for all of the attacks except Earth Force cause only minimal damage. 
And even if he does you should be able to use "Aura" / "Wish" / Mist Potion 
to do some fast healing.

 Attack weapons that work best are the Wind & Water Elemental Unleash 
weapons like Excalibur and Masamune, but the Sol Blade's Megiddo does quite 
some damage on him so that shouldn't be an issue. On the other hand armor 
that raises Wind Power like the Feathered Robe / Aeolian Cassock / Leda's 
Bracelet are great to have and can increase the amount of damage you deal 
considerably.

------------------------------------------------------------
The Easiest Strategy - Kill the dragon without enemy actions
------------------------------------------------------------
 After some toying around I found a possible setup that can take out the 
Doom Dragon in just several rounds. The key to his defeat lies in the 
Excalibur/Sol Blade & Tomegathericon. It does require you to have 
at least one character on level 47 however, because we are going to use the 
power of Dullahan called: Formina Sage! Note that this weapon/armor setup 
is purely optimized for Doom Dragon, so you may want to equip your 
characters like this just before entering the center of the Mars Lighthouse 
Aerie.

Anything that      Don't care         Don't care         Don't care
boosts ATK, but  
equiping just the
Masamune should
be sufficient    

This gives every character the following primary roles:

 Felix: Sol Blade's Megiddo
 Isaac: Use Lull the first turn
 Jenna: "Quick Strike"
 Garet: "Call Dullahan"
 Sheba: Boost party ATK (Forge & Kindle)
 Ivan:  Summon Catastrophe
 Piers: Summon Azul
 Mia:   Summon Boreas & Ulysses (additional backup)

 Since you can't do 5000 damage the first turn (unless you use up all the
strongest summons rightaway or have Level 90+ characters) the main strategy 
of this setup is to get your attack and elemental power up the first round,
then have Isaac use Lull to prevent Doom Dragon from executing any attack. 
The next round Jenna comes in and with the attack & elemental power buffs 
you should be able to maximize damage to slay a head of Doom Dragon each 
round. The main damage comes from Felix using Sol Blade's Megiddo & Garet 
using "Call Dullahan" to cast the almighty Formina Sage attack. Hence Garet 
has equipment for maximal ATK power and Felix for a near guaranteed weapon 
unleash.
 
 During the first two turns Sheba's high agility ensures that you can get
both Kindle & Forge's ATK boosts in order to strike with maximal power. After
that she can be exchanged for any other member with Djinn on standby. With
the given setup and level 48 party members the attack pattern and damage
results should be as following:

Round #1
-----------------
Sheba - use Kindle         0 Damage -> Felix/Garet ATK +12.5%
Felix - Azul           ~1000 Damage -> Venus Power +60
Garet - Catastrophe    ~1700 Damage -> Jupiter Power +100 (Maximizes)
Isaac - use Lull           0 Damage -> Doom dragon gets no turn

Turn ends immediately because of Lull. 
Doom dragon gets no chance to attack.

Round #2
-----------------
Exchange Isaac -> Jenna

Sheba - use Forge          0 Damage -> Jenna/Felix/Garet ATK +12.5%
Jenna - Quick Strike   ~ 600 Damage
Felix - Megiddo        ~1100 Damage
Garet - Call Dullahan  ~1200 Damage

Turn ends immediately, as Doom Dragon's 1st head is slain.
Doom dragon gets no chance to attack.
 
Round #3
-----------------
Exchange Sheba -> Ivan

Jenna - Quick Strike   ~ 600 Damage
Felix - Megiddo        ~1100 Damage
Garet - Call Dullahan  ~1200 Damage
Ivan  - Catastrophe    ~1600 Damage

Turn ends immediately, as Doom Dragon's 2nd head is slain.
Doom dragon gets no chance to attack.
 
Round #4
-----------------
Exchange Ivan -> Piers

Jenna - Quick Strike   ~ 600 Damage
Felix - Megiddo        ~1100 Damage
Garet - Call Dullahan  ~1200 Damage
Piers - Azul           ~1200 Damage

Battle ends immediately, as Doom Dragon's last head is slain.
Doom dragon gets no chance to attack.
-----------------

 Under normal circumstances the dragon should not be too difficult to beat.
Doom dragon might use up a turn for 'Defend'/Guard Aura, but when that
happens it does lose a turn for the other commands. So the battle might
be a turn longer, but you can still bring in Mia whom serves as a backup.
She has 6 Mercury & 2 Mars Djinn on standby allowing you to summon both 
Boreas & Ulysses. Moreover, you could let her remaining Djinni be Shade, 
Eddy or another Djinn you prefer to ensure the recovery goes easier. As
the damage values show there's enough leeway, even if Megiddo isn't 
unleashed so you should be pretty safe as long as your agility is better 
than Doom Dragon. For a demo watch following the above strategy watch
here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCOiIE1fOX0 .


 It is also possible to defeat the dragon by slaying a head each turn. This
does require high level characters and a near ultimate equipment set, using
3 Excaliburs together with the Tomegathericon. A video at this URL of 
youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDLhMBS31Vg . This here is a video
showing the destruction of the Doom Dragon in 3 turns without the dragon
ever getting a chance to attack. :P
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 After the battle everybody finds out what Kraden already expected. The 
three heads were the parents of Felix and Jenna and Isaac's father Kyle. 
The Mercury Adepts Piers and Mia step forward in a last effort to save them 
from death, but the battle has taking its toll on them and the victims are 
to close to death to be brought back. Even though this is a tremendous 
loss, everybody agrees that if the last beacon isn't lit it was all for 
naught. You regain control of Felix and you can talk to everybody, just 
before you finally throw the Mars Star into its rightful place to finally 
end your quest.

 After this happens the lighthouse tears apart similar to what happened at 
the Venus Lighthouse. The beacon rises up and starts to glow mysteriously. 
This event with all four beacons lit releases Alchemy into the world. Two 
children at the Mercury Lighthouse are now able to "Mind read" over a huge 
distance with Mia. It turns out the Wise One send a message to them telling 
everybody to leave the lighthouse as soon and as far as possible. Master 
Hamma also blends in the conversation and after they decide to leave the 
beacon of Mars stars to turn color. The Golden Sun is forming right now. 
The screen flashes and you are back in Prox again. 


--Prox--
 After a short conversation about what is going to happen you regain 
control of Felix once more. Isaac & Kraden join you and the rest is waiting 
for you to the south of the village. You can now walk outside Prox that is 
more calm now that the storm raging over it has settled down.

 Go to the south exit and everybody including the three parents are 
standing up strait. It turned out that the Wise One did have a plan to save 
them after all. The Psynergy emitted from the Mars Lighthouse reenergized 
them so they live another day! After some more talking with Kraden the 
three of them wave their hands as a good bye. And the credits start to 
roll!


--Mt. Aleph--
 During the credits you'll see Alex climbing to the summit of Mount Aleph 
hoping to catch the light of the Golden Sun. Next you'll also see the four 
lighthouses - Mars, Mercury, Venus and Jupiter - each radiating a beam for 
one of the four elements they represent.

 In the last sequence Alex is holding his hands up trying to grasp the 
power. The earth starts to glow gold and Alex thinks that he has obtained 
eternal life and limitless power, then the Wise One appears again! He 
speaks down to Alex and tells him that the power is not exactly what Alex 
was hoping for. The Wise One puts him down and tells him that he must flee 
Mt. Aleph in order to live, because the mountain will be drawn into the 
earth. If the incapacitated Alex survives they might meet again in the
future...


--Vale--
 The screen is black here and everybody is eagerly awaiting to what became 
of Vale. Finally Felix speaks and says that Vale and Mt. Aleph are both 
gone! Fortunately as everybody thought the Wise One warned everybody and 
all families are reunited. You get to see some nice pictures and that's it.

You can also choose to save your file into "Clear Data", this allows you to 
restart a new game with the option to choose a difficulty setting as 
mentioned in the very beginning of the walkthrough. Take note however that 
the file you save over becomes unplayable (you can go to the battle arena 
however)!

Appendix A: Djinn & Classes
===========================================================================

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Djinn Descriptions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 In Golden Sun: the Lost Age there are 44 new Djinn you can find throughout 
the continents. Most of them are quite easy to find, while others may prove 
to be more difficult to locate. Here's a list of all Djinn sorted by 
element and the moment you can find them in-game. If you transfer not all 
Djinn from GS1, then 1 Djinn of each elemental type will appear again in 
this game. If you transfer all 7 Djinn of one type then that additional 
Djinni will not appear, because you already have it in your possession.

 There is one remark that has to be made here; the statistic boosts of the 
Djinn may differ from the values given here, this is so because classes 
affect the statistics relatively (i.e. in percentages). To put it simple 
this means that the upgrades may vary a bit. For more information on that 
topic see the third section about Class changes. The exact Djinn locations 
can also be found in the FAQ, just search for the Djinni's name with 
"Ctrl+F" in most Windows / Linux based text editors or viewers.

2. About the Summons
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Next to the original 16 Summons from GS1 some additional Summons are 
available in this game. The only difference is that these won't appear in 
the Summon List right away. Instead you need to find the so-called Summon 
Tablet which has an inscription telling you how to summon a new deity. Also 
these new spirits are multi-elemental meaning that they require Djinn of 
two different types. The attack of such a spirit is always mono-elemental, 
depending on the Djinn type that is dominant for that Summon. Most of the 
additional Summons also have extra side effects that are listed below the 
Djinn requirements.

3. Class & Psynergy Effects
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Next to these effects assigning a Djinni to a character may change his/her 
class level. In some cases these changes can create huge statistic upgrades 
and stronger Psynergy Spells, however in some cases the class may actually 
downgrade a character so experiment yourself to find out which classes are 
most suitable. Of course the clean sweep with all Djinn assigned to the 
characters with the same elemental is a good combination. Actually it seems 
to be the only good combination, whereas assigning 1 Djinni of another type 
to the list breaks up the entire set-up weakening the character to the 
lowest class possible. Later on however when you have more Djinn more 
interesting combinations take place. Here's a list of all the Class levels 
that each character can reach.


A word about the notation here:

- "x|y" means all number of Djinn between x and y. For example: 3|5
  means either 3,4 or 5 Djinn of that kind.

- All percentage were calculated after subtracting the effects of the 
  Djinn, so the actual percentage may appear even higher than listed
  here.

- an "->" denotes that the Psynergy is reused in the upgraded class
     "~>" denotes that the Psynergy is upgraded in the upgraded class

- After working in the ROM I finally found out that the base classes have 
  A certain percentages as well! This means that the statistics of a 
  character in its base class also receives some class bonuses.

This is the Monster Compendium and it has detailed data about all the 
monsters in this game. Most statistics speak for themselves, but some of 
tem are a bit harder to understand.

-Elemental properties are abbreviated:

      E = Earth   F = Fire    W = Wind    w = Water

-ICC stands for Item Chance Class, there are 9 classes ranging from 1 to 9. 
Each class has its own percentage with ICC1 = 100%. The next class (ICC2) 
has a drop chance of 50% and this gets halved each time. We get the 
following list:

     ICC1  = 100.0%
     ICC2  =  50.0%
     ICC3  =  25.0%
     ICC4  =  12.5%
     ICC5 ~=   6.3%
     ICC6 ~=   3.1%
     ICC7 ~=   1.6%
     ICC8 ~=   0.8%
     ICC9 ~=   0.4%

ICC9 is in this game only used for Cruel Dragon's Tisiphone Edge & Mad 
Demon's Lachesis' Rule. Other than that ICC2 is non-existent in this game. 
Most drops have a chance of ICC5 and ICC6, but most of those items are just 
weak and regular items. If you manage to pull off a Djinn Kill / "Dark 
Panther Method" (see below in stuff section) this class is lowered by 2, 
meaning that the chance is quadrupled! Hence if you use it on a Faery (ICC 
3) you are guaranteed to get a Nut, any time, anywhere!

-Monsters are sorted in four lists, one for regular enemies, one for the 
bosses (and non-regular enemies), one for the Mad Plants & Mimics and the 
last is for the Djinn. Also all monsters are listed by alphabetical order 
of their names.

 (WM) = Enemy can only be found on the World Map.

===========================================================================
Appendix C: Four Additional Dungeons
===========================================================================

 The following part is a bit similar to what Crossbone Isle was in GS1, but 
now there are four smaller dungeons instead of one big one. Next to all the 
obligatory caves and dungeons that you come across there are also four 
special dungeons. Each one has a powerful guardian at the end, that 
protects a powerful Summon Tablet. 

All of these dungeons can only be accessed very late in the game, because 
the "Teleport" Psynergy from the Mars Lighthouse is required for three of 
them. Hence the only exception is Treasure Island in the eastern sea, but 
in order to get all the good items and the Summon here you do need "Grind" 
from Lemuria and Isaac's "Lift" Psynergy. Anemos Inner Sanctum will always 
be the last dungeon you can visit, because it requires you to have all 72 
Djinn from both games in your possession. There is also Taopo Swamp 
(Chapter 7C. in the Walkthrough) as an optional place to go to, but you 
don't meet a strong boss or Summon Tablet there. Above all each dungeon 
features special enemies that rarely drop the strongest items and weapons.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Treasure Island
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Located in the north east corner of Weyard this dungeon is reachable very 
early in the game, but can only be completed after obtaining both "Grind" 
and "Lift". You can visit here several times, or go through the whole thing 
in one go after Isaac joins you.


--Treasure Island--
Chests: 11 (11)
 161 Coins, Lucky Medal, Jester's Armlet, 911 Coins, Sylph Feather,
 Rusty Axe(forges Viking Axe), Psy Crystal, Star Dust, Cookie,
 Iris Robe, Fire Brand
Djinn:
 Jupiter - Gale
 Venus   - "missing GS1 Djinni"
Stone Tablet:
 Azul
Monsters (Before "Lift" Rock):
 Stone Soldier, Turtle Dragon, Earth Golem, Cannibal Ghoul, Harridan,
 Horned Ghost
Monsters (After "Lift" Rock):
 Sea Hedgehog, Great Seagull, Pyrodra, Gillman Lord, Puppet Warrior
Boss:
 Star Magician

 From the start follow the left wall and you will reach two chests 
containing 161 Coins and a Lucky Medal, the four chests in the other rooms 
are all empty. Continue up and trigger the button on the ground (6 chests 
before this button are also empty). "Grind" the right spiky rock and go to 
the next room. In here jump your way to the column, but do not push it onto 
the switch, instead push it just one square to the south of it. Now, jump 
back to the other side and "Move" it from behind the rocks onto button. 
This way you can get past this obstacle.

 The next chamber forces you to trigger another button, "Grind" the 
rightmost spiky rock, jump to the back, climb the structure and use the 
tightrope to reach a Jester's Armlet. Go back, "Move" the right column over 
the gap to the left, "Grind" the leftmost rock and finally "Move" the 
pillar another square to the left. Follow the lower branch, to get back 
into the second room, "Move" the pillar out of the way and jump over the 
gap. If you didn't "Grind" the upper spiky rock you can reach those chests.
They contain: 911 Coins, Sylph Feather, Rusty Axe(turns into Viking Axe 
after forging), Psy Crystal, Star Dust and Cookie. Back in the previous
room follow the left wall and a Mimic awaits you.
-------
Mimic 9
-------
 HP:  879    ATK: 333    AGL:  196    Weak:   Fire
 PP:   76    DEF: 103    LCK:   18    Strong: Water
 Special: Debilitate, Psy Drain, Sleep, Curse, Nettle
 Exp:   1336
 Coins:  677
 Item: Power Bread

After a short battle go down the stairs to the north and use "Lift" on the 
rock here, which should be yours after you get Isaac to join your party. 
There are stronger enemies in the random battles behind this rock so 
beware. The Iris Robe can be collected fairly easy from the chest around 
here. "Lift" another rock so you can enter the room behind it. In this room 
"Lift" the center boulder and you can get to the Jupiter Djinni on the left 
side of the screen. 
--------------
Jupiter Djinni
--------------
 HP: 980     ATK: 309     AGL: 277       Weak:    Earth
 PP:  92     DEF:  97     LCK:  31       Strong:  Wind
 Special:  Destruct Ray, Sonic Slash, Spark Plasma, Tempest, Escape
 Exp:   1197
 Coins:  756
 Item: -

This Djinni is extremely fast so beware of his initial attack. When the 
quick battle is over Gale will team up with you. Felix can also collect the 
Fire Brand from the chest to the right. Reset the room by exiting and 
entering it again. This time use "Lift" on the leftmost boulder, the 
boulder behind it and the one in the upper right corner. Go south from 
there and jump over the gap to the left, climb the wall and exit via the 
upper southeast passage.

 If you are playing a game where not all Venus Djinn from GS1 are 
transferred then a missing GS1 Djinni appears on the left side of this room 
and joins right away. The end of this watery dungeon is near! Go up via the 
right branch and you'll reach the final room of this dungeon. Inside is 
powerful boss so be prepared. He tells you that in order to get the prize,
a summon tablet, behind him that you must defeat him in combat.

Star Magician & Balls

Star Magician

 Special:  'recover 10 PP', Flash Bolt, Shine Plasma, Storm Ray

 Coins:  30
 Item:    -


 As you can see this battle is about the Star Magician, which can produce 
various balls that make your life miserable. You have to take out the 
Refresh and Guardian Balls or else all your efforts are for naught. Because 
Earnest Ply and Guard Aura offer the Star Magician so much strength that 
you can barely scratch him. Of course the Thunder and Anger Balls are 
annoying as well, because of their damaging properties. The Star Magician 
himself is actually not that danger, but the combination is troublesome.

An effecient strategy on low levels would work with the following party:
 (Numbers in parenthesis are in stand-by)

Felix           Isaac           Jenna           Ivan
--------------  --------------  --------------  ---------------  
Ninja           Ninja           Flame user      Dark Mage

                                -Flash to Set   3x Venus(1)
                                                 -Ground to Set
                                                 -Petra to Set

--------------  --------------  --------------  ---------------  
Gaia Blade      Warrior's Helm  -               Elven Shirt
                                                Tomegathericon
---------------------------------------------------------------

4x Mars(4)
--------------  --------------  --------------  ---------------  
AGL > 300       'don't care'    'don't care'    'don't care'       
--------------  --------------  --------------  --------------- 
Clarity Circlet -               -               -
Aerial Gloves
Feathered Robe

In case certain characters have too little agility use some Quick Boots,
Running Shirt or Golden boots to boost them up. Once the AGL of the
required characters is over 300 this will ensure the Star Magician 
can't get a turn durin the second round. The Tomegathericon on Ivan
boosts his AGL as 2 Venus Djinn seriously hamper his class' base AGL.

With this setup you can enter the battle and use Flash on your own party
to prevent any serious damage. Next, Ivan can use Ground on the Guardian
ball to prevent him from casting 'Guard Aura'. However, because both
attacks are used with high priority Ivan's AGL must be higher than the
Guardian Ball to prevent him from getting a turn (otherwise Ground's use
is wasted). After that you can spam him with some Haures' unleashes. This
gives the following battle overview:

Round #1
-------------------------------------------------------
Ivan:  Ground on Guardian Ball
Jenna: Flash 
Isaac: Haures
Felix: Haures

 -> No 'Guard Aura' cast, leaving Star Magician open to damage
 -> 2600 Damage on Magician
 -> Refresh Ball dies
 -> Thunder Ball dies
 -> Star Magician & Balls attack (minor to no damage thanks to Flash)

Round #2
-------------------------------------------------------
Exchange Jenna for Sheba

Ivan:  Petra on Guardian Ball
Sheba: Eclipse
Isaac: Haures
Felix: Haures

 -> No 'Guard Aura' cast, leaving Star Magician open to damage
 -> 5200 Damage on Magician, Star Magician dies
 -> Guardian Ball dies
 -> Anger Ball dies
 -> Any balls spawned in the previous turn are either dead or weakened

For an example video you can watch it right here:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
When this battle is finally over read the text on the tablet behind the 
Star Magician and claim your new summon: Azul. To summon him use 4 Mercury 
and 3 Venus Djinn. This is the end of this optional dungeon.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Yampi Desert Cave
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 After you get "Sand" & "Teleport" Psynergies you can go back to Yampi 
Desert to get some additional treasures. The easiest route to the required 
part in the desert is by going to Alhafra by boat and then entering the 
desert from the south entrance.


--Yampi Desert--
 From the rear entrance use "Sand" on the leftmost sand slide (near the 
arrow formed by rocks that becomes visible with "Reveal"). Enter the crack 
in the wall for a hidden cave.


--Yampi Desert Cave--
Chests: 1 (12)
 Water of Life

 Get the Water of Life from the chest right at the start (hmm... that 
looked suspicious like a Mimic). Other than this there is not much to do 
around here. We need to get back here once we get "Teleport".


--Yampi Desert Cave (Inner Dungeon) --
Hidden Items: 1 (13)
 Mythril Silver 
Chests: 4 (17)
 Water of Life, Dark Matter, Orihalcon, Mythril Silver
Djinn:
 Venus - Crystal
Stone Tablet:
 Daedalus
Monsters:
 Fire Dragon, Minos Knight, Sand Scorpion, Soul Army, Winged Lizard
Boss:
 Valukar

 Use "Teleport" on the circular mark to enter the inner Desert Cave, which 
houses pretty strong enemies. In here use "Sand" in the most northern part 
to reach the broken pillar to the left. Cast "Burst" on it, walk around in 
the back room, push the logs out of your way and use "Sand" at the most 
northern part to reach a stairway. On the left use "Scoop" here so Felix 
obtains some Mythril Silver. 

 Follow the path, use "Sand" to reach the left side and "Move" on the 
pillar (you need it later on). Exit to the south to find a chest with 
Dark Matter in it. Go down again to reach a log pushing puzzle. 

  lower horizontal log = 1      left vertical log    = 3
  upper horizontal log = 2      right vertical log   = 4

 Push the following logs:

   1 -> Down,
   2 -> Up,
   1 -> Up,
   4 -> Right,
   Use "Sand" to get behind 1,   1 -> Down, 
   Use "Sand" to get behind 2,   2 -> Down,
   Use "Sand" to get left of 3,  3 -> Left

 Climb up the ladder, use "Move" on the column in the room behind and go 
back again. Head down one room, collect the Orihalcon and "Burst" the 
pillar on the elevated section. Back in the initial chamber go down the 
stairs on the left. Here you'll see something moving in the sand at a high 
velocity. Use "Scoop" on it the moment you are next to it to make a Venus 
Djinni appear. If you find it hard to get "Scoop" going a the right moment
you could try "Halt" on him with the transferred Halt Gem from GS, if you
got it in your inventory. This way the Djinni will freeze at the spot where
he is. Once you dig him up he gets mad at you for disturbing his rest 
so Crystal attacks:
------------
Venus Djinni
------------
 HP: 990     ATK: 309     AGL: 280       Weak:    Wind
 PP:  94     DEF:  97     LCK:  33       Strong: Earth
 Special: Grand Gaia, Nettle, Stone Spire, Thorny Grave, Wild Growth,
          Escape
 Exp:  1211  
 Coins: 764 
 Item: -

After this Crystal comes with you. "Pound" the cone pillar to the north, 
then get the pillar in the back room on the correct tile. Backtrack all the 
way to that spot on the upper level walk up to the room behind it and meet 
up with Valukar the elemental being of Fire guarding a Stone Tablet.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Valukar
-------------
 HP: 12960   ATK: 550    AGL: 206       Weak:   Water
 PP:     0   DEF: 175    LCK:  46       Strong: Fire 
 Special:  'attack 2x', 'Summon', Crucible, Djinn Stun, Stun Jip
 Exp:   8702
 Coins: 4980  
 Item:     -

With over 12000 HP you really need to do some heavy damage on this goon. 
Also he puts your Djinn on Standby with Djinn Stun and then he can use 
your Djinn to summon the your deities against you! So basically use Summon 
as much as possible (even weak ones) to make sure that he can't Summon them 
against you.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 After the battle with him you can examine the Tablet and you learn how to 
summon Daedalus. This spirit requires 4 Mars and 3 Venus Djinn to call. 
"Retreat" / or walk back out of this dungeon.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Islet Cave
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Islet of Time--
 After you complete the Animal Trade Quest you can enter this place (see 
Chapter 7D in the walkthrough). Go right up to the teleporter circle and 
"Teleport" to the inner corridor of this dungeon. This dungeon is pretty 
small actually! It is just several times the same corridor, but each 
consecutive corridor is darker than the last one.

--Islet Cave (Corridor)--
Djinn:
 Mercury - Serac
Stone Tablet:
 Catastrophe
Monsters:
 Chimera Worm, Cruel Dragon, Druj, Wonder Bird
Boss:
 Sentinel

BTW. The Cruel Dragons in here drop the infamous Tisiphone Edge one of the 
most powerful short blades.

 In the second corridor use "Tremor" to make a Mercury Djinni appear. This 
little guy is one of the last remaining Djinn in this game and will fight 
you to the end.
--------------
Mercury Djinni
--------------
 HP: 920     ATK: 290     AGL: 257       Weak:    Fire
 PP:  86     DEF:  90     LCK:  29       Strong:  Water
 Special:  Freeze Prism, Froth Spiral, Ice Missile, Megacool, Escape
 Exp:   1197
 Coins:  756
 Item:     -

 Personally I think that Serac finishing blow is the strongest Mercury 
based unleash, so use him well in Djinn Kill strategies. After this you 
have to go through 4 more corridors that get darker each time. At the end 
is a chamber where the Wind elemental warrior Sentinel awaits you.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Sentinel
--------------
 HP:  8736   ATK: 608    AGL: 171       Weak:   Earth
 PP:   780   DEF: 216    LCK:  54       Strong: Water
 Special:  'attack 3x', 'recover 200 HP', 'recover 30 PP', Armor Crush,
           Blue Bolt, Break, Destruct Ray, Guard, Searing Beam,
           Spark Plasma
 Exp:  10538
 Coins: 6144  
 Item:     -

 As you can see Sentinel can use "Break" so power ups are hardly useful. 
Try to use as many Earth elemental summons to get this guy down as fast as 
possible. He is a wind elemental yet he is strong against water not wind!
This may seems odd, but it is the truth.

To beat him easily, get all Djinn including Serac from this corridor and
visit the entrance of Anemos inner sanctum. There you can claim the tablet
for summoning Charon. If you return to Sentinel and set all your Venus
Djinn on standby you can summon Charon twice the first turn. Each Charon 
summon will do roughly 4000 Damage each, so you can beat this boss in one
turn. This battle is also available on video here:
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAcNhWykEmc
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 After the battle walk up to the Summon Tablet and you can now command the 
power that be Catastrophe. If you use this in battle it looks like 
Judgment, but bigger and stronger. It requires 5 Jupiter & 3 Mars Djinn put 
on Stand-by in order to command this deity.




---------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Anemos Inner Sanctum
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In Contigo you hear about the Sanctum of the Anemos, which seems to be 
sealed complete. If you take a closer look at it you'll find that one a 
chest with Dragon Skin is reachable directly. In order to get into the 
actual inner sanctum you need all 72 Djinn and "Teleport" (which you 
obviously must posses, if you have 72 Djinn).

--Anemos Inner Sanctum--
Chests: 3 (20)
 Dragon Skin, Dark Matter, Orihalcon
Stone Tablet:
 Charon, Iris
Monsters: 
 Bombander, Grave Wight, Mad Demon, Sky Dragon
Boss:
 Dullahan

 To reach the chest with Dragon Skin, go to Anemos Sanctum main entrance 
and use "Reveal" on it. You can walk towards the chest containing that 
item. For the rest nothing can be done here; this path is just a dead end. 
Use "Teleport" on the circle in the center of Contigo to reach the actual 
Anemos Inner Sanctum. In order to advance in this ultimate dungeon you need 
all 72 Djinn on order to open the door. If you have all Djinn walk up to 
each elemental symbol and light all 72 dots (one for each Djinni). This 
will cause the four flames to be ignited opening the way to the last set of 
enemies and items this game has to offer.

 Inside the same BGM is used as in GS1's first dungeon: Sol Sanctum (what a 
coincidence). Walk up to the unguarded stone tablet in order to inherit the 
power of destruction: Charon. He requires 8 Venus and 2 Jupiter Djinn. 
Charon is the second strongest Summon after the most deadly force we will 
obtain at the end of this Sanctum.

 Continue on downstairs, jump over the gap to the left and in the room 
behind carefully walk so the mimic stone on your left can reach the button 
and open the door for you. Watch out he mirrors horizontal movement! In the 
next room follow the right path, push the pillar to the right (shortcut) and 
in the room to the east press all the 7 buttons to activate the single 
tile elevator.

 On the next floor push the pillar to the far left, then go to the upper 
left corner and descend two floors. Walk to the left here, go down the 
stairs and collect some Dark Matter for the chest. Go back and enter the 
back room of that same part. You will come across another button pusher 
puzzle with cracked floor tiles. Follow these directions from the entrance:

   LDDLLUULLDDDDDDRRUURRDDRRRRUULLUUUUR

All lights should be on and you can go up to higher level. Take the passage 
leading down again, push the pillar to the left (shortcut), move on to the 
far right, "Lift" the boulder and take the lower passage. Follow the left 
wall and you'll see another mimic stone. In order to solve this puzzle get 
the mimic stuck above the lone green pyramid then walk down 3 or 4 tiles. 
The causes the mimic to be 3 tiles above you and Felix can easily guide to 
the button in the upper right corner without making the mimic fall in a 
gap. Back in the big room push the 3rd pillar to the far right.

 Head back to the boulder and use "Lift" to reach the upper room. Go down 
and push the 2nd pillar in the open gap, finally head back to the boulder 
again, "Lift" it for the third time, "Move" the pillar below to the far 
right, jump over the gap and "Move" the upper column to on the left button. 
Miraculously the door opens and we can continue on. Follow the left path 
for another mimic puzzle. This one is harder, though. Move in the following 
directions (take care that the mimic is in the center of an individual 
tile or else the pattern may not work!): 

 1. URRU      - mimic stone is stuck against the lone obstacle from below
 2. UUUR      - mimic stone is free and three tiles below you
 3. UUL       - mimic stone is stuck against the lone obstacle from above
 4. DDD       - the both of you should be on the same horizontal line
 5. RUULUULLL - Finish

In the next room let Felix go down the left stairs from some Orihalcon. The 
passage to the right leads to a room with three passages and 9 cracked 
floor tiles in the center. Go to the left path not touching the upper and 
right tiles (they must remain complete). "Move" the pillar on the far 
right, go down the center path and use the tiles that are left over to 
reach the right path. Cast "Sand" on the sandy area and you'll come by the 
pillar you just moved. Move it even farther to the right go up and push the 
last column out of your way. 

 In the final room complete the 6 tile block puzzle representing a bird. 
This is not difficult, but will take some time to complete. WARNING: This 
is the final moment to save or "Retreat". After saving go over the gap the 
battle against the strongest enemy commences and beware strong he is 
indeed. Use "Hover" on it after bird it is activated. You'll be transported 
to an area for a showdown with a headless knight. This is the legendary 
Dullahan! "I am the shadow the keeper of light. If you want the sun's 
power, show me your own". After these words the knight steps forward 
towards you.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Dullahan
--------------
 HP: 16000    ATK: 676     AGL: 241      Weak:   Wind   
 PP:   300    DEF: 269     LCK:  59      Strong: Earth 
 Special:  'recover 200 HP', 'Attack 2x', Bind, Break, Condemn, Curse,
            Djinn Storm, Element Swap, Formina Sage, Summon 'Charon',
            True Collide
 Exp:  15600
 Coins: 6775
 Item:     -

 Similar to Deadbeard, this adversary is the optional boss that is much 
more powerful than the final boss in the game. As you can see the 
statistics of this fiend are through the roof. Djinn are hardly useful 
here, because one Djinn Storm and they will ALL go in recovery mode. You 
really need much power to get him. There is however a small consolation for 
the Hard Mode players; Dullahan's HP can never exceed 16383 due to 
technical restrictions (see the glitches section in appendix F). So you 
only have to cause roughly 16000 Damage either way. 

 The standard way of doing combat will cause defeat way too soon even for 
high level parties, therefore a strategy has to be devised. Try to get at 
least you base class agility of some of your characters above that of 
Dullahan with a margin (at least 250) or else he may attack before you, 
screwing your attacks up.

    Dullahan's Main Attacks
    ------------------------------------------------------
    Djinn Storm    - Put all Djinn in recovery mode!
    True Collide   - Absorb HP damage
    Formina Sage   - >700 damage
    Elemental Swap - Waste a turn; next turn will be Summon Charon!


------------------------------------------------------
The Easiest 2 Round Strategy - The Jupiter Summon Rush
------------------------------------------------------
 Here is one strategy that might work out for you. Because Dullahan puts 
all Djinn in recovery with a huge chance you might as well try to Summon 
Rush him with the following set up. In both your parties put at ALL your 
Djinn on Stand-by. I used the following item setup on a party of, which the 
level is irrelevant! If the AGL of the base classes is below 250, then I 
suggest training against Wonder Birds in Islet Cave to raise it very 
quickly.

Attack Party
============
Ivan               Jenna              Sheba              Felix / Isaac
-----------------  -----------------  -----------------  -----------------
Wind Seer          Flame User         Wind Seer          Apprentice

AGL > 250*         AGL > 250*         AGL > 250*         AGL > 250
Jupiter Pow: 164   Mars Power: 164    Jupiter Pow: 154   Venus Power: 144
-----------------  -----------------  -----------------  -----------------
9 Jupiter Djinn    7 GS1 Mars Djinn~  8 Jupiter Djinn    5 Venus Djinn
                   2 Mercury Djinn    1 Venus Djinn      3 GS2 Mars Djinn~
                                                         Jupiter Lull

All on Stand-by    All on Stand-by    All on Stand-by    All, but Lull on
                                                         Stand-by
-----------------  -----------------  -----------------  -----------------
Swift Sword        'any weapon'       'any weapon'       Gaia Blade
'any helm'         'any helm'         'any helm'         Warrior's Helm
Leda's Bracelet    Big Bang Gloves    Leda's Bracelet    'any shield' ^
Feathered Robe     Ardagh Robe        Feathered Robe     Planet Armor
-----------------  -----------------  -----------------  -----------------

* = Use Running Shirts, Running boots if AGL is less than Felix/Isaac.
    They must attack before Lull is unleashed. In case that is not
    enough you can also try to raise it with Mint, or give the Venus
    Adept some Safety Boots to slow him down...
^ = If you transferred the Spirit Gloves from GS1 then equip them
    for 5 more Earth points.
~ = Jenna's Djinn must be drained by Summoning BEFORE Felix's. Therefore
    Set her Djinn manually BEFORE setting Felix's.

Back up Party
=============
Garet                    'other Venus Adept' / Mia / Piers
-----------------        ---------------------------------
Guard                    'variable'

AGL > 250
Mars Power: 154          Power doesn't matter
-----------------        ---------------------------------
2 Mercury Djinn          All the Djinn that are left over
7 Mars Djinn

All on Stand-by
-----------------        ---------------------------------
'any weapon'             Whatever you like best & left over
Ninja Hood (AGL+)            "
Big Bang Gloves              "
Planet Armor                 "
-----------------        ---------------------------------

 Indeed, the weapons & armors listed above is all you need, nothing more 
and nothing less! Armors like Warrior's Helm, Planet Armor, Big Bang 
Gloves, Leda's Bracelet & Feathered Robe are a must; you CANNOT afford to 
miss these. Notice that I gave the Venus Adept the Gaia Blade, because 
raises Earth Power. Finally, this is a party setup that is optimal for this 
and only this battle!

 The rest of the lot is actually superfluous for the following reason. This 
party prefers elemental increases over strong defense or attack, because we 
are going to beat him using Summons solely and Dullahan never even gets the 
chance to attack. Therefore we need as much elemental power as possible. 10 
additional points for Elemental Power makes a BIG difference when summoning 
here, because the increase is much more significant. Just make sure that 
Ivan, Sheba & Jenna are all quicker than Felix, who in his turn must be 
faster than Dullahan.

 You need to Summon Catastrophe, Eclipse & Daedalus in the first round, so 
that's why Felix, Jenna & Garet have such an odd Djinn combination. Jenna 
will be exchanged for Garet hence all of her Djinn need to be drained, 
whereas Felix's Mars Djinn must remain active. In order to make sure this 
happens you have to put her Djinn on 'standby' manually before setting 
Felix's. Doing this will make sure those Djinn get drained earlier. 

 Exchange 1 Venus Djinn for Felix and give him Lull on SET (again: make 
sure Felix is the slowest of the four even after he changes into Apprentice 
class). Use Lull to prevent Dullahan from attacking at all & it puts Lull 
on Stand-by for another Catastrophe. That's 2 doing two things at the same 
time! About the attacks I can say the following; use Catastrophe! This guy 
does more damage than Charon and can be summoned three times in two rounds 
with this setup as well. Many people think that Charon is the Summon to 
use, but this is not true. Charon's Damage / Djinn ratio leaves him too 
weak to be of real use for the simple reason that Dullahan's Venus 
resistance is too high. With this setup I got the following damage on Hard 
mode (I rounded the values down to give you even more room!).

First round:
 6 Venus, 10 Mars, 17 Jupiter & 2 Mercury on Stand-by
------------
 Ivan:  Catastrophe           ~3500 Damage (Jupiter Power maximizes)
 Sheba: Eclipse               ~2100 Damage (Jupiter Power maximizes)
 Jenna: Daedalus' Initial      ~900 Damage
 Felix: Unleash Lull              0        (Dullahan can't attack!)
                              -----
 Dullahan Recovers HP          -200 Damage 
                              ----- +
                              ~6300 Damage

Second Round:
 3 Venus, 3 Mars, 10 Jupiter & 0 Mercury on Stand-by
-------------
 Exchange Jenna for Garet
 3 Venus, 10 Mars, 10 Jupiter & 2 Mercury on Stand-by
-------------
 Ivan:  Catastrophe           ~4000 Damage
 Sheba: Catastrophe           ~4000 Damage
 Garet: Ulysses               ~1500 Damage
 Felix: Haures                ~1700 Damage (Dullahan should die now)
                              -----
 Daedalus' Delayed Missile    ~1500 Damage
                              ----- +
                             ~12700 Damage

6300 + 12700 ~= 19000 Damage so any party following this setup can kill him 
in a mere two rounds in Normal or Hard mode. Provided that the base 
elemental powers of your characters are strong enough (see equipment)! The 
Delayed Missile of Daedalus is actually not even required, but it is just 
there in case he survives Haures.

 Your attack party may have very poor defense, but even if he manages to 
kill all four then the Back-up party comes into play at the end of the 
second round. On top of that this allows the Missile from Daedalus to bump 
in and kill him no matter what. So even if Dullahan kills everybody 
Daedalus will get his ass!

 As with Doom Dragon check the video: www.youtube.com/watch?v=caHWbRrTGxU. 
Here's a video showing the inventory just before the battle show the viewer
of the correctness of this strategy. It's nice video if you wish to see
many different summons in one go and watching D die without even getting a
chance to attack. :P
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 After a successful battle Dullahan seems to have left the building! :) He 
leaves Summon Tablet unguarded and open for you to examine. Take a look at 
it and now you are able to call upon the power that is: Iris (As a Lufia 
player I know that she is the goddess of the Rainbow). She is the ultimate 
summon who does not only deal enough damage to deliver the fatal blow to 
any normal monster, but she will also heal all party members completely 
(including the back up party!). She comes at the price of 9 Mars & 4 
Mercury Djinn, though.





===========================================================================
Appendix D: The Battle Arena
===========================================================================

 The Battle Arena is a special feature in the game that you can play just 
for fun. There are no treasures to be won here (actually you can't earn 
anything other than a new high score), but this is a nice additional 
section that can be good especially if you have some friends to compete 
against. The main thing the Battle Arena consists of is the Monster Battle 
and the Linked Battle as described below.

 In order to do battle you will have to collect your first Djinn (Venus 
Djinni: Echo) if you which to participate in the Battle Arena. I guess 
don't know the main reason behind this, but that is all that is needed. To 
get to the Battle Arena select the "Battle" option from the Main Selection 
screen after you start up your GBA. Then you will have to choose one of the 
save file. Pick the data file which you want to use; all your Characters, 
Djinn and Statistics will be used from that data file. After doing so Isaac 
will enter the arena's waiting Lobby. Check the map below for all the 
interesting parts (Looks more like a boat, if you don't see the perspective 
of this picture...):

Monster Battle
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Talk to the lady (1. on the map) behind the counter and the lady will ask 
if you want to battle a monster right away, when you don't have a second 
GBA connected to your GBA. If you do have a second GBA attached you will 
have to opt for the single player battle if you want to battle a monster. 
She'll tell you stand on the central circle (marked with o ) to start the 
battle. If you do so you'll enter the arena where you have to fight any 
monster that you have defeated in battle. This includes the bosses and so 
on, which means that even Doom Dragon and Dullahan may pop up if you have 
defeated them in that particular save file.

 I noticed that you'll only battle the strongest monsters you have 
defeated, which usually means many Dullahans and other bosses if you bested 
them. After checking out the statistics of the monsters I found out that 
the monster in the Battle Arena are a lot stronger than the ones in during 
regular game play. Just take a look at this example:

   All Hero Characters are on level 99 upon testing

   * = 16383 is the maximal value for HP an enemy can have, so it might
       have been even higher if it wasn't limited due to technical
       restrictions (See App. F for more details).
 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

 As you can see in the above table even a weak enemy like a Punch Ant can 
become a fierce opponent if your levels are really high. I am not entirely 
sure if only the levels alone determine the strength of your opponent, but 
it is certain that they become stronger when you are strong too. Therefore 
the monsters in the battle arena are a lot harder to defeat than during 
regular game play. Only the Elemental Resistances and Luck remain the same 
for each monster.

 There are some other differences with the regular battles too. For one 
thing you don't receive any item drops, experience and coins from the 
enemies you defeat in the battle arena. Secondly, if you party dies 
(including the back up party) this has no further consequences other than 
that your consecutive Battle counter gets a reset. Third thing is that all 
items you use aren't removed from your inventory if you play the regular 
story again. If you manage to beat a monster and you return to the main 
lobby you are asked to battle another random monster or quit. If you quit 
all your characters' HP and PP gets restored to the original values.



Linked Battle
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 When two GBAs who are both equipped with a Link Cable and they both have a 
game pack of Golden Sun: "the Lost Age" (no mixes with GS1 are allowed) of 
the same language you can do a Linked battle against your friend (Watch out 
when connecting European Versions of the game). An important rule in the 
Linked battle is that there can only be three allies in the same group in a 
Linked battle. Therefore Piers (and the entire Back up party) will fall out 
by default, if you wish to change this you need to move the characters in 
the statistics screen (press select, select the Statistics option and use L 
and R to move the characters from left to right here). Second Rule is that 
again you can't earn any Exp. and coins with these battles. Third and most 
important rule is that after the other player has inserted all of his 
commands you only have 15 seconds to set your characters attacks or else 
the will become "Defend" by default.

 Talk to the receptionist again and if the GBAs are connected properly you 
will get an extra option that allows you to challenge your opponent; if 
your opponent accepts this challenge you both have to step to the center 
circle for the battle to start. I myself didn't have much experience with 
the linked battles, but what I did remember from the few battles is that 
trying to Summon Rush (using all Summons at the same time) doesn't work 
well if you have an opponent that is not incredibly weak. Therefore you'll 
need to create good tactics to beat him, since with all the Djinn and 
healing/reviving spells it sometimes may take a very long time for the two 
of you to complete one battle.

 Most tactics you may have used against bosses in the regular game may 
prove ineffective, but you may find other weaknesses and exploit these. A 
very effective tactic is entering your attacks very quickly; leaving the 
other player only 15 seconds to think. This may seem a lot, but many people 
usually need more than that to come up with a good strategy so playing fast 
may be a possible tactic to win. Of course you need to bear in mind that 
playing fast can cause you to make errors all the same.

Appendix E: Golden Sun Linkage
===========================================================================

Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 So what's the deal with this linkage system you may have heard about 
already? Well, basically it allows you to transfer your data from GS 1 to 
GS2: the Lost Age so you can continue on where you left off in GS. This is 
a very nice idea and works fine although if you don't have a link cable & a 
second GBA you will have to do some very tedious and error-prone work 
first. To make things a little easier there are three levels of passwords 
which allows you to choose what you do want to transfer and what doesn't 
get transferred.

What gets Transferred
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 As I said in the introduction you can choose 3 levels of password you wish 
to transfer data. They are Bronze, Silver and Gold Medal passwords.

   Bronze                Silver                Gold
   -------------------   -------------------   -------------------
   Character Levels      Character Levels      Character Levels
   Djinn                 Djinn                 Djinn
   Psynergy Items        Psynergy Items        Psynergy Items
   Quest Data(*)         Quest data(*)         Quest data(*)
   -                     Character Stats       Character Stats
   -                     Coins                 Coins
   -                     -                     Items in Inventory

(*) = This data doesn't appear on the list, but it is in the password. 
Basically there are six different events that the password memorizes and 
send to the Lost Age, I was however unable to connect the 6th event... Each 
event will give you something (be it item or just a message) in Golden Sun: 
The Lost age. 

1  GS1:   Talk to the Mayor of Vault after the bandits escape
   Event: The bandits come by in Madra. After a battle you also get the
          Golden Boots

2  GS1:   Beat the Colosso Event in Tolbi
   Event: The Gladiators return in the Shaman Village Cave. After a battle
          you get the Golden Shirt

3  GS1:   Save Hsu at the Alpine Crossing before Hama does
   Event: Upon entering Champa you receive the Golden Ring from Feizhi for
          saving Hsu/Ulmuch(?)

4  GS1:   Beat Deadbeard
   Event: Some folks in Alhafra tell you that Crossbone Isle is swept clean
          and Deadbeard was defeated by Isaac.

5  GS1:   Save Master Hammet from Lunpa Fortress
   Event: You receive a chest with Orihalcon, when your ship gets wings.

6. GS1:   Talk to Dora in Vale after she gets ill (after reaching Altin)
   Event: Isaac has an extra segment of conversation with his dad about 
          his ill mother in Prox during the epilogue.


How to transfer data
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Actually this is described in detail in the Golden Sun: the Lost Age 
manual, so you should read that. It is possible however to look at the data 
right away using the "Send" option in the Game Selection Menu of GS1. In 
order to make this appear you need to have at least one "Clear Data" file 
on the GS1 cartridge. If you have one or more do the following:

   Start up your GBA with Golden Sun (1)
   Press 'start' to get to the main file selection menu
   Press and hold left on the D-pad
   Press and hold the R shoulder button at the top of your GBA
   Press 'B'

 A new option should appear on the far right of the selection menu: Send. 
Select it and you will have to choose which data file you which to 
transfer, you can only select the "Clear Data" files; e.g. the files that 
have been saved after finishing the game. Select one of those files and you 
get another option: Password or Cable. If you choose "Password" you can 
choose which level you want, before the game shows you the password. You 
have to write it down or (memorize it) and enter this in GS:tLA. This 
password is not that long for Bronze and Silver Medals, but Gold is lengthy 
5 pages * 50 characters per page + 10 additional characters = 260 
Characters in all.

 So I recommend you write it down carefully, since you don't want to 
receive an error after filling in all those characters in GS:TLA. The most 
problems occur with the letters that look similar in upper and lower case 
like: v,V u,U o,O w,W and so on. The Cable Option will automatically 
transfer the Golden Password to the Lost Age using 2 GBAs and 1 GBA Game 
Link Cable. This is a lot easier than writing down, but not everybody has 
two GBAs and such a cable around.


 Furthermore Chris Maka found out that using GBA SP with wireless linking
doesn't work. You really need two GBAs with a wired link, in order to
transmit the password over to the other cartridge. Apparently Nintendo
didn't design their hardware to be backwards compatible. If your uplink
doesn't work because of this, then you still have to use the manual
password.



Passwords
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Here are some of the most interesting patches you may want to use. There 
are three prefabricated passwords:

    -Maximum
    -Realistic
    -Collector

The first one has everything maxed out to get the strongest characters 
available. The second is game file played by me with normal items and 
statistics at the end. Finally the third password has about nearly every 
single artifact so you can get a complete inventory in the Lost Age.

 Take note that all passwords have been verified with the Password 
Generator made by Paulygon. I did this to prevent typographical errors in 
the password codes (I know how irritating an error can be if you just 
entered 260 characters). In other words:

            = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
              ALL PASSWORDS ARE VERIFIED AND ERROR FREE!
            = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

 There is however one thing I do wish to point out. On www.neoseekers.com
some of the characters are misinterpreted into HTML codes (e.g. "&" sign
becomes "&amp;"). I cannot resolve this problem as the error lies at
Neoseeker's servers not mine. Please interpret the aformentioned html code
with the ampersand sign. See this picture for an example:
               http://i17.tinypic.com/6g2ergj.jpg



Maximum - a hacked password for THE strongest setup
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 This password was generated with the objective of making the game as 
simple as possible (from the perspective of the battles). Initially I used 
Paulygon's Password Generator to create this password, but I noticed that 
it is possible to get ANY item from GS2 transferred to GS2. So, I made up 
my own password that features all of these Uber-items. The statistics are 
raised to the highest possible levels, but the actual effects may vary due 
to Djinn or Class properties. I deliberately put the characters on level 54 
so all the Psynergies are available and yet you can train them even 
stronger by leveling up.

 I also included four of those pretty Ninja Sandals (dummied out... 
normally), because they seem to be more effective than Hyper Boots. At 
first I tried to include "Orihalcon *30", but that didn't work out properly 
and the same goes for the others like Mist Potion and Mythril Silver. You 
only get 1 of them once the password is read in GS2. I know the problem 
lies in the GS2 cart, because the password itself did store it as 
"Orihalcon *30".

The main features of the password are:

  999999 Coins
  All Djinn
  60x each Statistic Increasing Item
  All Psynergy Items
  All Side-Quest completed
  All Characters Level 54
  All Statistics maxed out (as far as possible, that is)

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is an actual game file played through to the end, that's why this 
password is realistic. This is for everybody who wishes to be able to get 
every feature in GS2, but who doesn't have the original GS or doesn't need 
to be a god and ruin the game play. To be even more specific it is the game

the password are:

  813168 Coins

Collector - Nearly Complete Inventory
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This password mainly focuses on getting a complete inventory so you have 
ALL artifacts this game provides. There are more than 60 Artifacts not 
attainable in GS2, therefore I had to drop some of them. This is so because 
the party members can only carry 15 * 4 = 60 Items at most. I chose to drop 
the following items/artifacts: 

   -Frost Jewel      Mia & Piers have it already
   -Douse Drop       Mia & Piers have it already
   -Cloak Ball       "Cloak" isn't used in GS2
   -Halt Gem         "Halt" isn't used in GS2
   -Empty Bottle     Can be obtained from Hermes Water
   -Cell Key         Useless in this game
   -Black Orb        Useless in this game
   -Mars Star        Is already removed from inventory when Isaac joins

 If you can find a way to drop even more artifacts (i.e. that can be found 
in this game) it might be possible to transfer these items as well.

===========================================================================
Appendix F: Bugs, Glitches and Stuff
===========================================================================

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 -So far no real bugs in this game. Yowza!



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glitches
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Here I will describe some of the mistakes in the game that may seem odd, 
but don't influence game play too much.


Walking off screen in Taopo swamp
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the swamp area where you find the Venus Djinn repeat you can get 
yourself stuck offscreen. when you blow away the Venus Djinni, directly 
south of the pillar you just moved there is a slide. When you take this 
slide like usual, nothing happens and the game progresses. Now hold down 
the RIGHT button while sliding down. This means you actually press the 
RIGHT and DOWN together and keep them pressed. When you do that the game
doesn't trigger the map transition event to the next screen. 

You can walk on the 'bottom' of the screen while Felix's sprite is 
invisible. Monster encounters occur, actually everything is the same except 
for a way to escape. The only thing one can do is use the load game trick 
which sends you back to the last visited sanctuary.


The stone that wanted to be a waterpuddle
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Shaman village, go to the place where you found Mercury djinni Eddy
and look for the water puddle to the right. Right next to it is a rock, but
if stand one tile above it and press down, your character will jump over
it as if it was a water puddle too.


Stone soldier can't use his "Mad Blast" Psynergy Attack (AGAIN)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Up to this moment this is the only enemy script glitch I could find in the 
entire game, is identical to the one in GS1. The Stone Soldier you come 
across in Treasure Island has 6 PP, but in order to cast Mad Blast (a spell 
this creature has) he needs 10 PP. So this means that this creature has to 
skip a turn, if he tries to use this Psynergy.

 I guess the programmers didn't take into account to give him at least 10 
PP even after 2 years of the original release! I wonder if they would have 
fixed it if GS3 would have appeared...


Dullhan's HP in Monster Battle & Hard Mode
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 It is widely known that Dullahan has 16000 HP in combat during regular 
gameplay. Many people also know that Hard Mode features enemies that have 
150% of normal HP and 125% ATK and DEF. So naturally one would think that 
Dullahan has 24000 HP, but this is not true!

 The game cannot give creature more HP than 16383, for the following 
reason. HP is stored in two bytes each containing 8 bits (oddly the first 
bit isn't used at all, which means 15 bits only), but the value is signed 
hence the first bit determines plus or minus. So we have fourteen bits 2^14 
- 1 = 16383, which is the maximal value for enemy HP!

 Lucky you, or else it would have been 24000! This saves you 7617 HP, but 
then again you still have to worry about his increased attack and defense 
power. On the other hand Summons grow stronger as the maximum HP gets 
larger so it might actually become even easier to beat big D. BTW: the same 
thing applies to Valukar, his HP would exceed this value as well but is 
bounded too in Hard Mode.


Infinite Item Reproduction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hmmm... yes, there is this glitch in Trial Road brought to my attention 
via Jeffrey Ng. It deals with duplicating some items including the class 
changing items (the Tomegathericon, Trainer's Whip and Mysterious Card) 
allowing you to get all your characters in that class! All items work 
except: Apple, Bone, Bramble Seed, Cookie, Crystal Powder, Hard Nut, Large 
Bread, Laughing Fungus, Lucky Pepper, Mint, Power Bread, Sleep Bomb, Smoke 
Bomb & Weasel Claws. Hence you can duplicate rings, boots, shirts and the 
class items.

 The trick is to drop any equiped item(s) during Trial Road and then 
before completing it you must leave this area. And with dropping I mean
dumping them, not putting them in a blue chest. By doing so your items 
return in your inventory, but mysteriously duplicates will also appear 
in the shop lists as if they were sold... This allows you to keep on 
generating new items, hence four Tomegathericons or Hyper boots can be 
obtained which is normally either impossible or very hard!


Sand Raising glitch in the Ankohl Ruins
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you go into the room in the Ankohl Ruins, where you step on the button
and the sand rises to a certain level, wait until the sand stops pouring 
from the head. Do a soft reset WITHOUT saving inside that room. You will 
reappear in the room with the sand at its highest level. The bottom 1/5th 
of the screen is glitched and you can step on the button again and the sand 
will raise and cover half of each platform. The sand stops right before the 
door so you can exit and re-enter to reset the room (note: this glitch 
might cause corrupt data, so try it out with caution).


Mars Lighthouse's air cracks when breathing fire
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
After beating Karst & Agatio in the Mars Lighthouse reuse "Blaze" on the 
flamy pillar to make the heads spit out more fire. If you do this the
same special effects will be used causing the 'crack' graphic that 
previously displayed on the ice sheet to appear floating in the air.


The biggest fireball in GS, and yet it can't even hit Felix
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
When travelling through the Mars lighthouse you come upon a section with a
switch which activates a moving/blazing dragon head. At a certain point 
the head will ignite a larger dragon statue causing a huge fire ball to be
shot at you.

 Usually, you run between all the ice shards towards the exit before the
ball hits you or otherwise you have to start all over again. However, if
you push the switch and stand still the ball will go right through you
giving you a free ride to the end of the corridor with ease! For some
reason the ball can't hit you when you remain on the switch.

 Hmm... the people at Camelot became a bit sloppy in this last dungeon I
reckon.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stuff
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Piers' Lash Pebble non-issue in Lemuria
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Initially, I heard that when Piers is gone from your party during your
stay in Lemuria you could get stuck. This because when Piers carries the 
Lash pebble there would be no way to get to Lunpa.

 Afterwards, many people mailed me about my mistake and so I fix this issue
by telling all others to use another random psynergy on the "Lash" rope,
when Piers has the Lash pebble. When this happens Lunpa comes outside and
throws down a ladder. Case closed.


Rename - all main protagonists
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 When you get to rename Felix at the beginning of a New Game press 'Select' 
3 times. You will hear a chime. Complete his name and you get to rename the 
other three members.

When you are renaming the characters from GS:tLA press the following button 
combination:
               Up,   Down,  Up,   Down,
               Left, Right, Left, Right,
               Up,   Right, Down, Left,  Up

Now press 'Select' and there will be chime as well. Take note that this 
only works, when you are playing a non-linked game.


Put all your Djinn on Set / Standby in one go
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 A little trick that may be very handy before entering a boss battle to 
save yourself from doing tedious work is pressing and holding the 'R' 
button and then press 'select' to set or free all Djinn with a single 
command. Handy if you do not wish handle each one separately.


Warp back to the last Sanctum
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whenever you continue a saved game you can start in the sanctum you last
visited by pressing: Shoulder L, Shoulder R & Start buttons.


Infinite Game Tickets
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 If you run out of Game Tickets you can sell or buy some equipment, but the
more Game Tickets you obtain the higher the value of your purchase needs to
be in order to get a game ticket. You can however get Game Tickets for
a relatively cheap price by doing the following. Note that this tactic
doesn't work 100% of the time, but it should get you tickets with 2-out-3
chance.

 1. Go to any item shop
 2. Buy 30 Nuts from the item selling clerc for a Game Ticket
 3. Return to the main menu (where you choose between Buy/Sell/Repair)
 4. Repeat step 2. & 3. and sell them if your inventory is full.

The crux of this strategy is that you return to the main menu
(Buy/Sell/Repair) before buying any more Nuts. If you don't do this the 
trick won't work. KrrA_InAgOtAbLe who found this interesting method made a 
video about this on Youtube:
              http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ynt3X5KK2z4

 Otherwise, you can use "Scoop" on various locations some random items may
appear including (but not limited to) Herbs, Nuts, Antidotes & Sleep Bombs, 
but also on rare occasions Game Tickets may appear. This way you can get as 
many tickets in this game as you wish... However obtaining them may be a 
very tedious chore.


The rumor of the 'legendary' Wheat Sword
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 For some reason there are always rumors about special items in many games. 
In this game some people started to spread another silly rumor. Supposedly 
there is a sword in this game called the Wheat Sword. This item has "Flying 
Dutchman" as its unleash and has mindboggling statistics... Of course being 
skeptical about this I initially thought this rumor would kill itself over 
time. But I've received some mails about it so here's the deal: The Wheat 
Sword does NOT exist.
 Here's my proof: each item (be it weapon/armor/item) has a special 
identification number within the game so the computer knows which item it 
is dealing with. I hacked the game to get the complete list of items, and 
guess what? The Wheat sword didn't appear among them.
 End of proof. Tuff luck guys the weapon is a ruse, so think of something 
more realistic next time. :P


Sheba suffers from delusions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 When you first sea out to sea on Piers' ship the four adepts and Kraden 
talk about what already happened and what is still to come. Here Sheba 
mentions that they've met Werewolves and learned new Psynergies.
 The thing is that you can reach the Lemurian Ship without visiting Garoh 
or Air's Rock (you don't need "Reveal" to get this far). So I tested this 
out and skipped Air's Rock and Garoh completely, but Sheba still insists 
that she saw Werewolves! How can this be? Is she dreaming or something?


Hsu's naming inconsistency 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 If you meet Feizhi in Champa Felix gets to hear that Isaac saved a guy 
named Ulmuch in GS(1). This is strange, because there exists no Ulmuch in 
that game. He did save a man named Hsu however. To keep things simple the 
cause of this is the bad translation done by the English translators. They 
probably forgot that they named him Hsu in the previous game and came up 
with Ulmuch instead for this game...

Dummied out monsters
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As you might have notices most of the monsters in the game consist of
series that typically feature three variations of the same monster. Even
the monsters of which only appear in single or doubles almost all have a 
third monster that wasn't used in the game, but is present in the game's
code. They even have proper names and could have been used as such, but
never appear anywhere. Here's a short list of the additional hidden monsters
that are found inside the cartridge:

Aeshma        (3rd variant of Aka Manah    / Druj           series)
Dark Murder   (3rd variant of Assasin      / Slayer         series)
Dragon        (3rd variant of Blue Dragon  / Cruel Dragon   series)
Crazy Gorilla (3rd variant of Chestbeater  / Wild Gorilla   series)
Poison Shell  (3rd variant of Conch Shell  / Spiral Shell   series)
Dinosaurus    (3rd variant of Dino         / Dinox          series)
Bane Wight    (3rd variant of Doom Sayer   / Lich           series)
Winged Runner (3rd variant of Emu          / Talon Runner   series)
Spirit Army   (3rd variant of Ghost Army   / Soul Army      series)
Mini-Death    (3rd variant of Gressil      / Little Death   series)

How to find out your enemies' Elemental Weakness
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 If you don't know which to which element an enemy is weak you can easily 
check it by looking at the end of the line, when you perform an attack.

  'Damage here' !!! = Enemy is weak to this element
  'Damage here' !   = Enemy is not weak nor strong (normal) to this element
  'Damage here' .   = Enemy is strong against this element

 It can be quite convenient to find out which type of element you need to 
use on your opponent. Of course there are more uses for knowing your 
opponent's weaknesses and strength see the sections below here for 
additional data on those.


Special Djinn Kill Bonuses ("Dark Panther Method" for enlightened people)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Many people know this common and nifty trick already, but if you don't 
read on. If you can kill an enemy with a Djinn Attack of which the element 
is the weakness of that enemy you will see that the enemy will make a 
second Growl and changes color several times before it dies. Next to that 
you receive 133.3% of the regular Experience and Coins, on top of that the 
chance for an Item drop get Quadrupled too (ICC lowers by 2). This method 
is handy if you wish to gain more experience or if you want to increase 
your chances for one of those Rare Item Drops like the Tisiphone Edge.

For example take the Wonder Bird, which is weak to Water and has ICC 8 for 
dropping some Dark Matter:

 Regular Kill                  Djinn Kill (Mercury Djinni in this case)
 ------------------------      ------------------------
 Exp. :  8622                  Exp. : 11496(!)
 Coins:   333                  Coins:   444
 Dark Matter Drop: 0.8%        Dark Matter Drop: 3.2%

As you can see the numbers can increase quite a lot, when you are fighting 
a strong enemy. 3.2% is still not much chance for an Item Drop, but there 
is a way to increase this to 100% by exploiting a little programming glitch 
using RNG methods. I don't have much experience with RNG methods so I would 
like to refer the reader to other documents (for example on Gamefaqs.com) 
that provide information about these strategies.

 Luckily for you these kills only work in your advantage; if you kill an 
enemy with a Djinn against which the enemy is strong you still receive 
normal Experience and Coins.

 There is however one small drawback to this method that may cause this 
method to fail sometimes. The elemental power of the attacker must be at 
least 41 points higher than the elemental resistance of an enemy. For 
example a Druj is weak to fire (Fire resistance = 72). So the attacker must 
have at least 72 + 38 = 110 Mars Power the moment he/she unleashes the 
lethal Mars Djinni, if it is less the Druj will not flash and does not drop 
more Exp. & Coins then usual.

 As a final remark I would like to say that this method for getting more 
Rare Items is by some people also referred to as the "Dark Panther Method" 
for he was the first person to find out about these properties.


Abusing RNGs (Random Number Generators) for your benefit
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This game (as well as GS1) uses 2 RNGs (random number generators) to 
determine everything that should happen with a 'random' chance. Computers 
however are actually not suitable to generate true random numbers, because 
they behave deterministically (i.e. applying the EXACT same input from the 
same starting state always yields the same results). This leads some people 
to find strategies that abuse these RNGs so they can force specific 
outcomes, which should normally be determined by pure chance.

 Golden Sun actually has a pretty simple RNG function that can be abused 
very easily to get the specifically required result time after time. The 
first RNG is used in battle and determines the whether weapons use their 
unleash, attacks cause a status or a monster drops his item. The other RNG 
is there to determine randomness of effects in the field. Below I've listed 
several exploits that allow you to get certain things done (100% of the 
time), which are normally near impossible to attain in one single attempt.

 GS:tLA however has a slightly modified RNG which makes it harder to exploit 
some of the quirks that were possible to do in GS1. The Perfect Bonus 
strategy for Tolbi's Lucky Dice will NOT work in Contigo's booth. The 
reason for this is that the Field RNG is modified in such a way that the 
generated numbers depend on the button presses, when the games starts 
(regardless of a hard or soft reset). The Battle RNG is still the same so 
it is still possible to get all the ultra-rare items with 100% success 
rate. The only problem is finding a fixed monster battle after starting the 
game. In some cases this can also work into your advantage as well, as some 
hard to find enemies in GS1 (e.g. Thunder Lizard and Grand Golem) may 
appear right away. Take note that it is still possible to get the desired 
results with the Field RNG, but it requires good timing skills.

Field RNG
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 -None yet. I heard of a method to get the Excalibur by forging
  Orihalcon at Sunshine, but I don't know how it works.

Battle RNG
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
This random number generator can be abused in such a way that you can 
always get the required item drop from an enemy. This can be very handy if 
you wish to get an item that is extremely rare like the Lachesis' Rule from 
the Mad Demon. It has normal drop rate of 0.4%, and even with a Djinn Kill 
it is only a mere 1.6% chance (see above in the stuff section).

You can get the item guaranteed if you manage to kill the required enemy 
when the RNG has used exactly 28 numbers. To be honest the number turns out 
to be 31 deploying the Djinn and killing the enemy consumes 3 more random 
numbers. So to keep things simple I will stick to 28. Furthermore, there 
are other magic numbers too, but they won't work on enemies with extremely 
rare item drops. The question is how do you know at which number the RNG 
is? You can't see it and even if you could you wouldn't know at which 
random number it is. The solution to this problem is using the following 
method in general:

   -Restart your game with a Hard Reset by turning the power switch Off
    and On. When you reload your game the battle RNG resets and it will be
    on the first number; this is your reference point.

   -Enter the battle with the enemy that has your item of choice. This has
    to be the very first battle you come across, at least for the strategy
    I am going to describe below. This part is harder in GS:tLA as the
    other RNG is harder to exploit, so just get lucky to find the required
    enemy.

   -Use exactly 27 random numbers before killing the specific enemy that
    holds the item with a Djinn Kill. The death of the enemy will use
    another random number, hence it will be on 28 (your magic number) when
    it is downed.

   -If the monster had the flashy colored death with a double growl AND the
    RNG was on number 28 THEN you will automatically receive the item you
    desired.

 In case there are any other monsters left in the battle you can finish 
them off any way you like, just make sure you complete the battle. The item 
is going to appear no matter what in the battle end messages if these first 
four steps are completed. This sounds complicated, but it not too hard. 
Below I will provide a short list of all the RN eating battle methods. If 
you don't want to spend time on creating your own RNG methods just look at 
the examples below.

Type of event in battle     | RN usage     | Example
----------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------
Start of Battle             | 1            |   -
Enemy's Turn (per action)   | 1            |   -
Enemy's Death               | 1            |   -
                            |              |
Attack (w/o Unleash)        | 1            |   -
Defend                      | 0            |   -
                            |              |
Psynergy: Attack            | 2 per target | "Briar" on 3 targets = 6 RN 
Psynergy: Heal              | 2 per target | "Wish" on 4 allies   = 8 RN
Psynergy: Additional        | 1 per target | "Resist" on 4 allies = 4 RN
Psynergy: Ailment Status    | 1 per target | "Bind" on 1 target   = 1 RN
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There are some initial requirements that have to be met or else the 
following strategies will NOT work. 

 First point: Make sure that the Djinn Kill will cause the double growl and 
colored death of the enemy, because if the elemental power of the character 
that unleashes the Djinni is too weak the Djinn Kill itself will fail 
rendering the entire strategy to be doomed (see Djinn Kill Bonuses for more 
information on this topic). Therefore you should stick to the Djinn setup 
with Isaac having all Venus Djinn and Mia getting all the Mercury Djinn and 
so on for the others. Just make sure the power of their natural elemental 
type is as high as possible. In this game you also want to avoid using 
Mold, Whirl, Gale and Gasp as their unusual attack pattern may cause the 
RNG to fail.

 Second point: As you can see in the methods below there is one initial 
attack in the second turn for most of the strategies. This means that the 
Djinn unleashing character has to be slower than the fastest member. This 
could give rise to a problem if you need Ivan to unleash his Jupiter Djinn, 
because he is by far the fastest member. In order to overcome this give 
somebody an Elven Shirt, Running Shirt and/or Running Boots to boost the 
agility to a level that he/she can outrun Ivan.

 Third point of interest: you have to make sure the statistics of your 
characters are not too weak/strong, because prematurely killing on of the 
enemies in the group will consume an additional RN and thus screws up the 
entire strategy once again. If this happens, just use a weaker version of 
the Psynergy that is mentioned (e.g. use "Flare" instead of "Flare Storm"). 
Now without further ado here are some strategies I came up with for 
collecting those pesky ultra rare item drops. There are strategies here for 
the following enemy / item combinations in order of appearance in the game 
we have:

  Dropped Item           Linked Enemy
  ---------------        ---------------
  Staff of Anubis  <->   Red Demon
  Prophet's Hat    <->   Dread Hound
  Otafuku Mask     <->   Gressil
  Tartarus Axe     <->   Minotaurus
  Unicorn Ring     <->   Sea Dragon
  Aura Gloves      <->   Magicore
  Healing Ring     <->   Nightmare
  Feathered Robe   <->   Wild Gryphon
  Aeolian Cassock  <->   Wyvern
  Rising Mace      <->   Blue Dragon
  Mist Potion      <->   Grand Chimera / Macetail
  Rune Blade       <->   Lesser Demon
  Hiotoko Mask     <->   Little Death
  Clotho's Distaff <->   Minos Warrior
  Gloria Helm      <->   Aka Manah
  Giant Axe        <->   Earth Golem
  Tear Stone       <->   Gillman Lord
  Sylph Feather    <->   Great Seagull
  Salamander Tail  <->   Pyrodra
  Blessed Mace     <->   Turtle Dragon
  Triton's Ward    <->   Ocean Dragon
  Atropos' Rod     <->   Fire Dragon
  Riot Gloves      <->   Minos Knight
  Star Dust        <->   Sand Scorpion
  Mythril Silver   <->   Soul Army
  Tisiphone Edge   <->   Cruel Dragon
  Dark Matter      <->   Wonder Bird
  Golem Core       <->   Bombander
  Lachesis' Rule   <->   Mad Demon
  Orihalcon        <->   Sky Dragon

 Fourth point: you canNOT wear any cursed equipment on any of your 
characters. This because cursed items eat up additional RN, causing any of
the strategies to fail. Using the Cleric's ring won't make any difference,
if you are stuck with such an item you must unequip it at a Sanctuary.

 Last note: I will leave out the Battle Start, 'Enemy' attacks and 'Enemy' 
dies after the first strategy. Also note that the enemy will NEVER attack 
the very first turn, when you load a new game. This makes this kind of 
strategy even better to use, because your opponents won't do anything the 
first turn (but they do use up 1 RN per enemy though).

   A video link to a battle against Dullahan using my strategy. It shows
   how Dullahan can be defeated on low levels without taking any damage at 
   all!

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDLhMBS31Vg
   A video link to the battle against the Doom Dragon created using the
   strategy previously mentioned in the FAQ. It's still nice to show the
   Dragon can be in a single turn (for each head). But now there's a more
   usuable strategy available in the video below.
   
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=
   A video link to the battle against the Doom Dragon created using the
   current strategy mentioned in the FAQ. You'll find this more usuable as
   it requires much less effort of the player to get these levels and 
   items as they are all pretty common. For the tradeoff of an additional
   turn which ends with using Lull you can still slay the other heads in
   single rounds. ^_^
